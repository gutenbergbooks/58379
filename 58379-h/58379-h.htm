<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>As a student of child psychology and always
most deeply interested in the welfare problems
that confront us in connection with the upbringing
of little children, I went to Rome in 1913 to
study, first-hand, the results of the Montessori
system of education. A great deal had been
written and said in connection with the technic
of the system. Little had been given the world in
regard to individual children who were developing
their personalities through the auto-education of
Montessori. I wished to observe Montessori children.</p>

<p>Through the gracious courtesy of Dr. Montessori,
I was given the privilege of observing in
the new Trionfale School where the method could
be watched from its inception, and in the Fua
Famagosta and Franciscan Convent Schools. I
was also given the privilege of hearing Dr. Montessori
lecture, elucidating certain problems in her
theory of education not previously given publicity.</p>

<p>I found little ones of three, four, and five years,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
surrounded by the many observers of the first international
Montessori training class, yet so marvelously
poised and self-controlled that they went
through the days as if alone. I saw such proofs
of the integrity of the system as the instances of
Otello, Bruno, and others.</p>

<p>The pages which follow constitute a series of
pictures of real child types showing Montessori
results. As a record of results, I hope they may
contribute to the world’s greater faith in the discovery
of Montessori—the spirit of the child.</p>

<h2 id="DR_MONTESSORI_THE_WOMAN">DR. MONTESSORI, THE WOMAN</h2>

<p>A holiday in Rome, the Eternally Old, the
Eternally Young. A long, sun-dried street that
flanks the Tiber is gay with fruit venders who
push along their carts of gold oranges, strings
of dates, and amber lemons. Italians of the
wealthy class mingle in friendly fashion with the
native-costumed peasants. Someone starts a
snatch of song; a dozen passersby take up the
strain. Where the chariots of the Cæsars rattled
by in yesterday’s centuries, there rises a stately
row of stucco apartment mansions with terraced
gardens where pink roses and purple heliotrope
run riot over the hedges and silver-toned fountains
sing, all day long, their tinkling tunes.</p>

<p>Leaving the gay, bright street, you ring the
electric bell at number 5 Principessa Clotilde.</p>

<p>“Is the Dottoressa at home, or is she keeping
holiday, too?” you ask of the porter. He laughs,
motioning you to an almost human elevator that
lifts itself and will stop at whichever floor you ask
it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, La Dottoressa Montessori is in—in fact,
she is nearly always in because of the many people,
mainly Americans, who come to see her. And the
children come daily to see her as well.” The porter
shrugs his shoulders, uncomprehendingly, as you
enter the elevator and stop at the fourth floor.
The popularity of this tenant of his is a matter
of wonder to the porter.</p>

<p>As a low-voiced maid opens a great carved door
and you find yourself in Dr. Montessori’s apartment,
you hold your breath at the modernism of
it. Plain white woodwork, fine old rugs covering
the stone floors, the soft tan walls covered with
a few beautiful tapestries; French furniture and
electric lights. The reception room in which you
wait might be that of an American home, but a
glance out of the open window unfolds to you the
heart of the tenant. While her home is in one
of the most beautiful and cultured centers of Rome,
Dr. Montessori sees daily a tiny, narrow Roman
alleyway where the “people” live like bees in a
hive and the doorsills throng with little children
and their voices rise to her every hour of the day.</p>

<p>But you hear a step. You turn. You are face
to face with Maria Montessori.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>At first you have no words. You have seen her
picture in America, but it gave you no conception
of the fine, chiseled beauty of the woman who
stands before you dressed in severe black that
accentuates the marble of the classic features, the
depth of the far-seeing, dark eyes. Poise, grace,
self-control, sympathy, love of humanity are
written on the face. It is as if all the Madonnas
of the imagination of the old Italian painters had
come to life in La Dottoressa. Overpowering the
first glance of courteous welcome, though, that accompanied
her outstretched hand is a look of stern
query.</p>

<p>Why have you come? Are you another of the
curious visitors who have besieged her from almost
every nation the past year to try and grasp in a
day her method of teaching that she gained only
through twenty years of patient, tireless scientific
study of the child mind, she seems to ask. But
your words come like a torrent now. You assure
her that you have made this pilgrimage to Rome,
not as an individual, but as the voice of thousands
of mothers who have children to be educated.
They ask Dr. Montessori, through you, for her
message to the American people. As you linger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
over the words, <i lang="it">madre</i>, mother, and <i lang="it">bambino</i>, baby,
Dr. Montessori smiles. You have set her doubts
at rest. She talks fast, eloquently, in her musical
Italian, and you listen, thrilled, fascinated. Often
you are interrupted, but always by children.
Lovely, dark-eyed, courteous little Roman boys
and girls they are. They come from you know
not where, are admitted to Dr. Montessori’s apartment
quite as if they were adult visitors, and after
they have greeted her in their graceful, polite
fashion, they quietly run about the room or sit in
groups talking together as if the apartment were
the popular meeting place for all the children of
the neighborhood. You find their interruption
and their presence a help instead of a hindrance
to your interview. They illustrate by their loving
friendship for La Dottoressa and each other, and
by their complete self-control, the message that
Dr. Montessori gives you to carry back to the
American people.</p>

<p><em>She would liberate the children.</em></p>

<p><em>The American people are free, but American
children are not.</em></p>

<p>We have lost sight of the Republic of Childhood,
she says. Through forcing our adult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
standards of conduct and teaching upon children,
we have closed the gateways of their souls. We
must believe that every child, well-born into the
world, is going to be good and happy and intelligent
if we as parents and teachers give him a fair
chance. We must stop <em>commanding</em> our children.
Instead, we will <em>lead</em> them.</p>

<p>Dr. Montessori tells us that we are undergoing
a slow but certain change in the social structure
of society. Woman is being emancipated from
her domestic slavery of yesterday. We are creating
a new and more healthful environment for
the laboring man. But the American child is still
a slave to the capricious commands of his parents,
which claim his soul and prevent his free, natural
development to his best manhood. In school, too,
children are still bound.</p>

<p>The vertebral column, Dr. Montessori tells us,
which is biologically the most fundamental part
of the human skeleton; which survived the desperate
struggles of primitive man against the
beasts of the desert, helped him to quarry out a
shelter for himself from the solid rock and bend
iron to his uses, cannot resist the bondages of
the present-day <em>school desk</em>. Curvature of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
spine is alarmingly prevalent among children and
is increasing. Instead of resorting to surgical
methods, corsets, braces, and orthopædic means
for straightening child bodies, we should try
to bring about some more rational method
of teaching that children shall no longer be
obliged to remain for the greater part of
the day in such a pathologically dangerous
position.</p>

<p>Not only do we hurt child bodies by the confinement
of the school desk, but we wound their
souls by ever offering rewards and punishments,
by insisting upon such long periods of absolute
silence as are demanded in our schools, and by
imposing upon children a program of instruction
that is built, often by law, to be followed by
large groups of children. The normal child is he
who finds it impossible to follow a program of
school work or to obey, unquestioningly, the arbitrary
commands of his parents. He must follow
his own bent, providing he does not interfere with
the freedom of others, if he is to dig out his own
life path. The abnormal child is the one who
<em>never resists</em>; he is the child who, without dissent,
obeys all adult commands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>So Dr. Montessori, who has discovered a method
of free teaching by means of which children from
two and a half to five develop naturally and happily
along lines that culminate in a spontaneous
“explosion” into self-taught reading and writing
at four and five years, speaks to the American
parent.</p>

<p>She begs us to give our children the freedom
that is the American nation’s boast. Not the
freedom that would lead to disordered acts, but
that liberty which means the untrammeled exercise
of all the moral and intellectual powers that are
born with the individual.</p>

<p>About twenty years ago Maria Montessori, a
beautiful young society girl of Rome, startled
Italy by receiving with honors her degree as Doctor
of Medicine. The Italian girl of the cultured
classes is essentially a home girl. She studies at
home, she embroiders, she plays with flowers, she
is introduced to society—then she marries. That
Maria Montessori should desert the quiet, rose-strewn
paths of Roman débutantes and, after taking
her degree, act as assistant doctor in the Psychiatric
Clinic of the University of Rome, startled
all Italy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>Her work at the clinic led her to visit the general
insane asylums, and she became deeply interested
in the deficient children who were housed
there, with no attempts being made to educate
them. As she studied these helpless little ones,
the idea came to her that it might be possible, by
putting them into better surroundings, and giving
them opportunity for free gymnastic activities
and free use of the senses, to educate them. She
gave up medicine for teaching and again startled
Italy—and the world. Her deficient children
learned to read and write, easily and naturally,
and took their places beside normal children in the
municipal schools.</p>

<p>Then Dr. Montessori carried her method of
physical and sense education a lap farther. If this
method stimulated to action the sleeping mind of
a deficient child, might it not save time and energy
in the teaching of normal children, she asked herself.
At that time, the Good Building Association
of Rome was tearing down the squalid, disease-filled
houses of the poor of the San Lorenzo
Quarter and putting up in their places hygienic
model tenements. Dr. Montessori arranged to
have the children of each tenement gathered in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
one room of the basement, where large, free
spaces, didactic apparatus, hot meals, and gardens
would make it a Children’s House. She applied
her method in numerous of these Children’s
Houses and in the beautiful convent of the Franciscan
nuns on the Via Giusti.</p>

<p>Again the miracle happened. Children of four
began to read and write, having taught themselves.
There were other wonders, too. These Montessori-trained
children were self-controlled, free, happy,
good. To-day there are Montessori mothers all
over the world.</p>

<p>To furnish the right environment for the expanding
of the child soul, Dr. Montessori urges
that every home be transformed into a House of
Childhood. It will not consist alone of walls, she
tells us, although these walls will be the bulwarks
of the sacred intimacy of the family. The home
will be more than this. It will have a soul, and will
embrace its inmates with the consoling arms of
love. The new mother will be liberated, like the
butterfly bursting its winter cocoon of imprisonment
and darkness, from those drudgeries that
the home has demanded of her in the past, leaving
her better able to bear strong children, study those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
children, teach them, and be a social force in the
world.</p>

<p>The new father will cultivate his health, guard
his virtue, that he may better the species and
make his children better, more perfect, and
stronger than any which have been created before.</p>

<p>The ideal home of to-morrow will be the home
of those men and women who wish to improve the
human species and send the race on its triumphant
way into eternity.</p>

<p>So Dr. Montessori, physician, psychologist,
teacher, lover of children, and womanly woman,
speaks to us.</p>

<p>As one says <i lang="it">addio</i> and leaves her and goes down
into the blue, star-filled evening of the Eternal
City, the night seems to be charged with a new
mystery. Rome, who holds in her beautiful hands
such good gifts for us—art, sculpture, history,
painting—now offers to us another. Stretching
farther than the moss-grown stones that line the
Appian Way, she shows us a new road—the way
that leads to the soul of a little child.</p>

<h2 id="WITH_MARGHERITA_IN_THE_CHILDRENS">WITH MARGHERITA IN THE CHILDREN’S
HOUSE<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Showing the Unconscious Influence of the True
Montessori Environment</i></span></h2>

<p>It is so early in the sweet, perfume-laden Italian
morning that the dew is still hanging in diamond
drops on the iris and roses in the garden of the
Casa dei Bambini of the Via Giusti, Rome. The
great white room, with its flooding sunlight and
host of tiny, waiting chairs and tables, is empty,
quiet, calm.</p>

<p>Margherita stands a happy second in the wide-arched
doorway that makes room and garden melt
into one fragrant, peaceful whole. A wee four-year-old
girlie is Margherita, big-eyed, radiant
with smiles, and tugging a huge wicker basket of
lunch that is almost as large as she. She is the
first baby to arrive at the Children’s House. Ah,
but that does not ruffle her composure. She is
already alone in her newly-found freedom of spirit.
She needs no teacher.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>She places the lunch basket on a waiting bench,
crosses to a wall space where rows of diminutive
pink and blue aprons hang at comfortable reaching
distances for little arms. She finds her own
apron, wriggles into it, <em>buttons</em> it at the back.
She is ready for the day.</p>

<p>What shall come first in Margherita’s day? So
much is in store for her, waiting for her eager
finger tips, her electric-charged soul. As her great
brown eyes slowly trail the room and the colorful
garden outside, it is as if she were making a soul
search for that “good thing” which will be her
first silent teacher. Her glance lingers on the terraced
rows of flowers, the tinkling fountain in the
center. She has found the object of her search.
She runs—no, she <em>floats</em>, for such complete physical
control of her limbs has this four-year-old
baby—to the garden, and kneels there, looking up
at a redolent, yellow rose that has opened in the
night. She does not touch it; she only looks and
breathes and wonders. She has watched for this
unfolding daily, waiting with sweet patience for
the branch to burst into bud and the bud to unfold
into bloom. She has tugged a vase of water each
morning to offer drink to the roots. Now her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
patience and her service are rewarded. As she
kneels there looking up into the petals of the gold
flower, her small hands clasped over her breast
with devotional ecstasy, <em>Nature opens her heart to
the heart of a little child</em>.</p>

<p>Many rapturous minutes the baby kneels. Then
she flies back to the room again and glances at it
with the critical eye of a housekeeper. Here she
flicks away a speck of dust, there she picks up a
scrap of paper from the stone floor. She peeps
into the wall cabinets that hold the Montessori
didactic materials to see if the gay buttoning,
lacing, and bow-tying frames, the fascinating pink
blocks of the tower, the frames of form insets are
all in their places. In the meantime the Signorina
directress comes. Bruno, of five, arrives, bringing
with him his two-and-a-half-year-old brother.
More toddlers trail in, two and a half, three, four,
four and a half years old, and button themselves
into their pink and blue aprons. Independent, polite,
joyous little children of the Cæsars they are,
each with his or her own special happy task in
mind in coming to the Children’s House this blue
day.</p>

<p>The wee-est toddlers drag out soft-colored rugs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
orange, dull green, deep crimson, and spread them
on the wide white spaces of the sun-flecked stone
floor. Here they build and rebuild the enchanting
intricacies of the tower of blocks, the broad stair
of blocks, and the red and white rods of the long
stair, chanting to themselves as they unconsciously
measure distances and make mental comparisons:
“big, little; thick, thin; long, short.”</p>

<p>Children of three and a half and four take from
the cabinets boxes of many-colored, silk-wound
spools, which they sort and lay upon the little
tables in chromatic order until a rainbow-tinted
mass lies before their pigment-loving eyes. From
the bright scarlet of poppies to the faint blush of
pale pink coral, from the royal purple of the tall,
spiked Roman iris to the amethyst tint of a wild
orchid, they make no mistake in the intermediate
color gradations. Other children of four and
over finger with intelligent, trained skill the geometric
forms; circles, triangles, squares that they
are learning to recognize through the “eyes in
their fingers,” and which will help them to see
with the mind’s eye the form that makes the beauty
of our world. Small Joanina, in her corner, runs
her forefinger with the greatest delicacy of touch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
a dozen times around a circle. Then she fits it in
its place in the form board, takes it out and fits it
in again. Then she looks up, a new light in her
eyes, darts out into the garden and walks slowly
about the fountain, running her finger around its
deep basin.</p>

<p>“Signorina, Signorina!” she calls. “The
fountain is a circle. I can see a pebble that is a
circle, too. I see <em>many</em> circles!”</p>

<p>So the children learn through the <em>exercise of the
senses</em>.</p>

<p>But Margherita?</p>

<p>All this time she has flitted from one task to
another. She found an outlined picture of clover
leaves and colored it with dainty pencil strokes,
making the leaves deep green and the background
paler, and handling her pencil with careful skill.
Then she took a box of white cards on which
are mounted great black letters, cut from fine
sandpaper. Holding each card in her left hand,
she traced the form of the letter with her right
forefinger, closed her eyes, traced its form again,
repeated the letter’s name to herself in a whisper,
sat silently a second.</p>

<p>As the Signorina directress moves from child<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
to child, smiling encouragement, showing Bruno’s
baby brother’s clumsy fingers how to slip a button
through a buttonhole, helping Joanina to find a
new form, the square, she watches Margherita.</p>

<p>“This may be a white day in the child’s mind
growth,” she thinks, but she does not suggest, or
hurry the miracle. She only waits, hopes, watches.</p>

<p><em>Silence</em> is written on the blackboard. Three
hours have passed in which over thirty children,
barely out of babyhood, have worked incessantly
at many different occupations, have moved
gracefully and with complete freedom about the
room, have changed occupations as often as they
wished, have not once quarreled. But now, out of
the ordered disorder, comes a marvelous hush.
No word is spoken, but one baby after another,
glancing the written sign, drops back with closed
eyes into a hushed silence in which the whir of
bird wings in the garden, the fluttering of casement
hangings, the far-away sound of a bell are
audible. Even Bruno’s baby brother struggles
not to make a clattering noise with his little chair.
No one has said to this two-year-old, “Be still.”
Rather, has he been inspired to <em>feel</em> stillness.</p>

<p>Out of the restful calm of the room comes the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
whispered call of the Signorina: “Bruno, Piccola,
Maria, Joanina, Margherita!” Lightly, noiselessly,
joyously the children come and huddle in
a hushed group about the directress. She has
called to the soul of each child, she has commended
them for their self-taught lesson in control.</p>

<p>As the work with the didactic materials is taken
up again, Margherita sits in a little chair for a
space, quiet, reflective. Her lips move, her fingers
trace signs in the air and on the table before
her. The Game of Silence has helped this four-year-old
with her spirit unfolding. Now, with a
sudden impulse, she darts to the blackboard, seizes
a piece of chalk, <em>writes</em>.</p>

<p>“Ma-ma! Ma-ma!”</p>

<p>Margherita writes it a dozen times in clear,
flowing script with breathless, eager strokes.</p>

<p>“Signorina, Signorina, I write—I write about
my mother. I <em>write</em>!” she joyously interpolates.</p>

<p>The other children look up with sympathetic
interest, some leaving their work to crowd about
the victorious Margherita. All of them voice their
sympathy.</p>

<p>“Margherita writes,” they say. With the
older ones who have already reached this wonder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
lap in their education there is a note of <em>nonchalance</em>.</p>

<p>“We also write,” they seem to say. With the
tiny ones there is a note of hopeful promise.</p>

<p>“Some day we, too, will find that we can write,”
they seem to say.</p>

<p>Margherita covers the blackboard with clear,
big script. She erases it all for the sheer joy of
assuring herself that she is able to write it all
over again. When the luncheon hour comes, she
looks back longingly at the blackboard as she lays
plates on the little tables with dainty precision,
places knife, fork, and spoon deftly, carries five
tumblers at a time on a tray without dropping
one, and passes a tureen of hot soup that is so
large as to almost hide her small self. Even the
happiness of being one of such a happy “party,”
of eating one’s lunch of peas and sweet wheat
bread and soup in the Children’s House, does not
wholly satisfy Margherita to-day. Her big brown
eyes are raised continually to her first written
word.</p>

<p>Luncheon over, the children, with balls, hoops,
and toys, romp out for an hour’s play in the
garden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>“Margherita,” Bruno calls. “Come, we will
have The Little One for a donkey, and I
will harness him with you, who may be the
horse!”</p>

<p>But the little girl, usually the first to start a
game, does not hear. She is seated under the
rosebush as if she were telling <em>her</em> rose the wonder
that has come to her to-day. She and the rose
have unfolded together. So it is with all Montessori
children. They open their souls as flowers
do, naturally, freely, surely.</p>

<p>Margherita is your child as well as the precious
<i lang="it">bambino</i> of her Roman mother. Children the
world over, from sun to sun, from pole to pole,
are the same in these plastic first years of mind
growth. They have the same insatiable desire to
<em>do</em>, to <em>touch</em>, to be <em>free in activity</em>. Not always
understanding the little child’s hereditary way of
grasping knowledge, we wound his spirit by crushing
these natural instincts. We say, “<em>don’t
touch</em>,” “<em>be still</em>,” because the activities of our
small Margheritas and Brunos interfere with our
adult standards of living.</p>

<p>Dr. Montessori has discovered that to say,
“<em>don’t touch</em>,” “<em>be still</em>,” to a child is a crime.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Such commands are the keen-edged daggers that
kill the child soul.</p>

<p>It is possible that some time will elapse before
Dr. Montessori’s system of setting the clockwork
of the little child’s mind running automatically,
of opening the floodgates of the child soul can be
adopted in their entirety in our American school.
We are so used to thinking of a school as a
crowded place of many desks, where children must
remain, bound physically and mentally by the will
of the teacher and the relentless course of study,
that a Montessori schoolroom where, as Dr. Montessori
herself expresses it, children may move
about usefully, intelligently, and freely, without
committing a rough or rude act, seems to us impossible.
We even prescribe and teach imaginative
<em>plays</em> to our children—as if it were possible
for any outside force to mold that wonderful
mind force by means of which the mind creates
the <em>new</em> out of its triumphant conquest of the
world through the senses.</p>

<p>Ideal Montessori schools may be our hope of to-morrow,
but to make of a home a Children’s House
is the fact of to-day.</p>

<p>To bring about Montessori development in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
home is not alone a matter of buying the didactic
materials and then offering them to your Margherita
and looking for their future miracle working.
This would mean stimulating lawlessness instead of freedom.
Many of our children already
play with squares and circles without seeing how
squares and circles make beauty in the architecture
of our cities. Many of our children grow up side
by side with opening roses without unfolding
with them. We would most of us rather button on
our babies’ aprons, tie their bibs, feed them, than
lead them into the physical independence that
comes from doing these things themselves. We
wish children to be obedient, but instead of establishing
principles of good in their minds which
they will follow freely, if we only give them a
chance, we <em>command</em>, and expect unreasoning obedience
to our injustice.</p>

<p>A Children’s House in every home will be a
place where the mother is imbued with the spirit
of the investigator. She watches her children, asking
herself why they act along certain lines. She
leads instead of ruling. She will teach her children
physical independence as soon as they can
toddle. To know how to dress and undress, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
bathe, to look quickly over a room to see if it is
in order, to open and close doors and move little
chairs, tables, and toys quietly, to care for plants
and pets—these are simple physical exercises
which help to keep children free and good. She
will provide her Children’s House with materials
for sense-training. She will lead her children by
simple, logical steps into preparation for early
mastery of reading and writing.</p>

<p>The first step, however, in giving the American
child a chance to develop along the self-active,
natural lines of Margherita is to fill our homes
with the spirit of Montessori. We will have unlimited
patience with the mistakes and idiosyncrasies
of childhood, remembering that we do not aim
to develop little men and women but only as nearly
perfect children as we can. We will endeavor to
surround ourselves with those influences of love
and charity and beauty and simplicity which it
will be good for our children to feel as well. We
will offer the children the best food, the greatest
amount of air, the brightest sunshine, the least
breakable belongings, the most encouragement, the
minimum of coercion.</p>

<p>Our attitude toward the child will be that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
the physician to whom the slightest variation of a
symptom is a signal for a change of treatment, to
whom a fraction of progress measures a span. A
careful home record of the child’s mental, moral,
and physical gain should be kept, and it will be
radiantly discovered that the removal of the burden
of force and coercion from the shoulders of
the little child will give him an impetus, not only
to mind growth, but to the attaining of greater
bodily strength.</p>

<p>Much misunderstanding of the system of Montessori
has come about through our too lavish interpretation
of the word <em>freedom</em> as lawlessness.
It should be interpreted, rather, as <em>self-direction</em>.
The home in which the children are provided with
good living conditions, in which it is made possible
for them to grow naturally, where their longing
to see and touch and weigh and smell and taste
is satisfied as far as can be arranged, and where
they are led to be as independent of adult help
as possible, is laying the foundation for the education
of Montessori.</p>

<h2 id="VALIA">VALIA<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>The Physical Education of the System</i></span></h2>

<p>Valia was her mother’s little stranger. Although
the mother had borne and fondled and
bathed and clothed and undressed the pink flesh
that held the baby soul, she did not know that
flesh. And Valia grew to be three years old, fat
and good, but with little bent limbs and a tired-out
spine and clumsy, fumbling fingers.</p>

<p>“Sit in your chair, Valia. That is what chairs
are made for,” Valia’s mother admonished at home
when the baby joyfully pranced across the floor
on “all fours” or lay prone at play with her
toys.</p>

<p>“Walk in the garden path like a little lady,”
she urged, when Valia, taken out for a walk,
climbed to the lowest railing of an adjacent fence
and walked along it, sideways, or hung from the
top, her fat legs swinging in the air.</p>

<p>“Do not jump; to jump is noisy and unbecoming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
in little girls,” the mother commanded, as
Valia, brought to the Trionfale Children’s House
in Rome, hopped gayly up and down the wide
stone steps.</p>

<p>But the directress of the school had no word
of reproof for baby Valia. She looked at the bent
legs that could hardly hold the weight of the
plump body, she glanced at the powerless baby
hands that could not clutch with any force the
handles of a toy wheelbarrow which another child
offered Valia for her play.</p>

<p>“You have not noticed the baby’s limbs,” the
directress suggested.</p>

<p>The mother’s eyes trailed the school yard where
Valia struggled to keep up with the other sturdy
little men and women who trundled their toy wheelbarrows
up and down in long happy lines. She
shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>“Perhaps they are crooked, but what can one
do to the body of a <i lang="it">bambino</i> but feed and cover
it?” she asked in discouraged query.</p>

<p>“Ah, La Dottoressa tells us,” the directress replied
simply.</p>

<p>“We can <em>know the body</em> of the little
child.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>The education of Valia’s muscles was begun that
very day, that instant.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 310px;" id="illus2">
<img src="images/illus2.jpg" width="310" height="500" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Back-yard apparatus for the physical development of
children is valuable.</p>
</div>

<p>In the school garden the little maid found her
way with the other children to an immediately
fascinating bit of gymnastic apparatus; a section
of a low fence it looked, its posts sunk deeply into
the ground so as to make it strong and durable.
It was the right height for small arms to reach
the top rail, which was round, smooth, and easily
grasped by small hands. Here Valia hung, her
limbs suspended and at rest, for long periods.
Sometimes she pulled her body up so that her waist
was level with the upper railing. It was a new
game, one could climb a fence without being chided
for it. Valia did not know, but Dr. Montessori
did, that little children climb fences, pull back
when we lead them, and try to draw themselves
up by clinging to furniture because they need this
form of physical exercise to bring about harmonious
muscular development. Valia’s body was
developing at an enormously greater rate than her
limbs. The height of your baby’s torso at one
year is about sixty-five per cent. of its total
stature, at two years is sixty-three per cent., at
three years is sixty-two per cent. But the limbs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
of the baby, ah, these develop much more slowly.
To hang from the top railing of a fence straightens
the spine, rests the short limbs by removing the
weight of the torso, and helps the hands to prehensive
grasping. So Dr. Montessori invented
and uses this bar apparatus with the children at
Rome and recommends its use in American nurseries
and playrooms.</p>

<p>The next Montessori exercise for Valia was a
simple, rhythmic one—walking on a line to secure
bodily poise and limb control.</p>

<p>It was just another game for a child, full of
happy surprise, too, for she never knew when the
sweet notes of the piano in the big rooms of the
Children’s House would tinkle out their call to
the march. But when the pianist played a tune
that was simple and repeated its melody over and
over again and was marked in its rhythm, Valia
and Otello and Mario and all the other babies put
away their work and fluttered like wind-blown
butterflies over to the place where a big circle
was outlined in white paint on the floor. To march
upon this line, now fast, now slowly, sometimes
with the lightness of a fairy and then with the
joyously loud tramp of a work horse, oh, how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
delightful! Sometimes the music changed to the
rhythm of running or a folk-dance step, and this
gave further delight to the little ones.</p>

<p>At first, Valia could not find the white circle
of delight. Her fat feet refused to obey the impulse
of her eagerly musical soul. But with the
days she found poise and grace and erectness and
the crooked limbs began to straighten themselves.</p>

<p>She sat, for hours at a time, in a patch of
sunlight on the floor, using her incompetent little
fingers in some of the practical exercises of everyday
living. The directress gave her a stout
wooden frame, to which were fastened two soft
pieces of gay woolen stuff, one of which was
pierced with buttonholes and the other having
large bone buttons. Valia worked all one morning
before she was able to fit each button in its corresponding
buttonhole, but when she did accomplish
this, the triumph was a bit of wonder-working
in Valia’s control of herself. It started her
on the road to physical freedom.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;" id="illus3">
<img src="images/illus3.jpg" width="300" height="500" alt="" />
<p class="caption">An important physical exercise of Montessori.</p>
</div>

<p>Happy in her new accomplishment, she mastered
all the other dressing frames; the soft linen with
pearl buttons that was like her underlinen, the
leather through which one thrust shoe buttons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
with one’s own button hook, or laced from one eyelet
to another, the lacing on cloth like her mother’s
Sunday bodice of green velvet, the frames of linen
with large and small hooks and eyes, the frame
upon which were broad strands of bright-colored
ribbon to be tied in a row of smart little bows.</p>

<p>Daily, simple physical exercises such as these;
hand and eye co-ordination, exercises in poise,
stretching, rest for the limbs and freedom for the
spine and torso slowly transformed Valia from a
lump of disorganized, putty-like flesh to an erect,
graceful, self-controlled little woman.</p>

<p>“What have you done to my Valia?” asked the
mother as she waited at the school door for her
little one a few months later. “She dresses the
young <i lang="it">bambino</i> at home and buttons her own
shoes. She no longer stumbles all day long but
stands well on her feet. She helps me to lay the
evening meal and carries a dish of soup, full, to
the place of her father. I do not understand it.
Did you punish her for climbing and being
clumsy?”</p>

<p>“No.” The directress of the Children’s House
lays a kind hand on Valia’s curly head as she
explains. “We did not punish Valia. We gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
her a fence upon which to climb and we let her
tumble about on the floor when she was tired, and
we helped her to find her feet and her fingers.”</p>

<p>Dr. Montessori tells us that there is a little
Valia in every home. The child from one to three
and four years of age is in need of definite physical
exercises that will tend to the normal development
of physiological movements. We ordinarily give
the little child’s body slight thought. Then, in
the schools, we gather older children into large
classes, and by a series of collective gymnastics
in which the commands of the teacher check all
spontaneity, we try to secure poise and self-control
and grace for the child body.</p>

<p class="caption">Hand and eye work in connection in exercises
of practical life.</p>
</div>

<p>Gymnastics for the home will accomplish this
result, Dr. Montessori tells us, and these include
simple exercises such as one sees in the Children’s
Houses. They are planned taking into account
the biology of the body of the child from birth to
six years of age—the child who has a torso greatly
developed in comparison with his lower limbs.
They have for their basis these goals:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Helping the child to limb development and control.</p>

<p>Helping the child to proper breathing and
articulate speech.</p>

<p>Helping the child to achieving the practical acts
of life; dressing, carrying objects without
dropping, and the resulting co-ordination of
hand and eye.</p>

</div>

<p>To bring about this physical development, Dr.
Montessori has planned and put into the Children’s
Houses in Rome certain very simple physical
exercises, so simple as to seem to us almost
obvious, but the results in child poise, control, and
grace have drawn the attention of the entire
world. These exercises include:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Swinging and “chinning” on a play fence,
modeled after a real fence or gate.</p>

<p>Climbing and jumping from broad steps, a flight
of wooden steps being built for the purpose.
Ascending and descending a short flight of
circular steps, these steps built for the exercise
at slight expense. Climbing up and
down a very short ladder. Stepping through
the rungs of the ladder as it is laid upon the
ground or the floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>Rhythmic exercises carried out upon a line;
walking slowly or fast, softly and heavily,
on tiptoe, running, skipping, and dancing in
time to music. These exercises may be done
by utilizing the long, straight cracks in a
hardwood floor, the seams in a carpet, by
strewing grain or making a snow line out of
doors.</p>

<p>Exercises in practical life, the most important
of these being brought about by the use of
the dressing frames included in the Montessori
didactic materials, and including: buttoning
on scarlet flannel, linen, and leather,
lacing on cloth and leather, fastening hooks
and eyes and patent snaps, and tying bow-knots.
Other materials used in these exercises
are: brooms and fascinating little scrubbing
brushes and white enamel basins with
which the children help to make the schoolroom
tidy in the morning. And the children
are taught to open and close doors and gates
softly and gracefully and to greet their
friends politely and with courtesy.</p>

<p>Physical training brought about through play
with a few toys that stimulate healthful muscular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
exercises and deep breathing. These
toys include rather heavy toy wheelbarrows,
balls, hoops, bean bags, and kites.</p>

<p>Breathing exercises. For these, Dr. Montessori
recommends the march, in which the little
ones sing in time to the rhythmic movement
of their feet, an exercise in which deep
breathing brings about lung strength. She
recommends also the singing circle games of
Froebel. She leads the children to practice
such simple respiratory exercises as, hands
on hips, tongue lying flat in the mouth and
the mouth open, to draw the breath in deeply
with a quick lowering of the shoulders, after
which it is slowly expelled, the shoulders returning
slowly to their normal position.</p>

<p>Exercises for practice in enunciation, including
careful phonic pronunciation of the sounds of
the vowels and consonants and the first syllables
of words. This practice in the co-ordination
of lips, tongue, and teeth not only helps
the child to clear speech but leads to a
quicker grasp of reading.</p>

</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 380px;" id="illus5">
<img src="images/illus5.jpg" width="380" height="500" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Walking upon a line gives poise and muscular
control.</p>
</div>

<p>Each of these physical exercises has its basis in
child interest. <em>Your</em> toddler instinctively pulls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
and climbs, stretches, and scrambles about on the
floor, longs to dress his own fascinating, wee body,
and play into the activities of the home. He
loves marked, rhythmic music and longs to hear
those jingles and nonsense ditties of childhood’s
literature in which syllabic sounds are emphasized
and repeat themselves.</p>

<p>“Not commands, but freedom; not teaching, but
observation,” Dr. Montessori begs of mothers.
So she has taken these instinctive activities of the
little child and, using them as a basis, she has
built upon them her system of physical training
for the baby, a system that needs no bidding,
“Do this,” because all children love to climb
fences and play with buttons and stretch little
limbs on the floor, and keep time to rhythmic music.</p>

<p>Every Thursday morning a crowd of thirty or
forty eager tourists from all over the world wait
with impatience to be admitted to the Montessori
school on the Via Giusti, Rome. Silently, led by
a white-robed sister, they enter the schoolroom
and seat themselves in quiet expectant rows to
watch the miracle of Montessori physical freedom.
A hush, a tinkle of child laughter, and the babies
flock in from the garden. Noiselessly, gracefully,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
with no rude jostling or crowding—and alone—they
greet each visitor with outstretched hands.
Then, like a bevy of little men and women, eager
to work, eager to achieve, they hasten to the cabinets
that hold the didactic materials, to choose
their material for the day. Nothing drops, nothing
is broken, no child hurts his neighbor in his
haste, and they find their places, some stretched
out on the floor, some seated at the white tables.
When the hour for the midday meal comes, the
materials are as carefully put back in their places
in the cabinet and the little ones lay the tables
for luncheon. To see a child balance a tray that
holds five filled tumblers, to see another child
bring in a huge bowl of warm soup and serve it
with no mishaps, these interest curious sightseers
as much as the Roman Colosseum or the Roman
baths.</p>

<p>But isn’t, after all, the child who has come, by
natural steps, to this control of his mind and body
the normal child? Are not our children, whom we
feed and dress and lead and fasten into high
chairs, the abnormal ones? It is vastly easier to
lace a child’s shoes, to hold his hand when he
goes up and down steps, to fetch and carry for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
him, than to teach him this muscular co-ordination,
but it is just this careful teaching of the
simple things of life that makes the Montessori
child a sight for tourists.</p>

<p>“What makes these children so good?” I heard
a visitor ask her neighbor one morning as she
watched the Via Giusti little ones.</p>

<p>A number of factors contribute to the goodness
of the Montessori child, but one of the most important
of these is that he “knows himself.” He
knows his body, what it can do and what it must
not do. This physical freedom leads naturally
and surely to freedom of the spirit.</p>

<h2 id="THE_FREEING_OF_OTELLO_THE">THE FREEING OF OTELLO, THE TERRIBLE<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Montessori Awakening of Conscience Through
Directed Will</i></span></h2>

<p>He was so wee a <i lang="it">bambino</i> to have absorbed so
much brutality in his heart. Not quite three summers
and winters old was Otello when his mother
pushed him across the threshold of the big, cool,
white room of the Trionfale Public School at Rome
that houses a Montessori Children’s House. There
she left him after a volley of guttural speech that
told the little dark-eyed girl directress how uncontrolled
and passionate was this baby of Rome,
a quaint little “man” in stuff dress and bare
legs and torn shoes who looked with stolid wonder
into the happy eyes of the other babies.</p>

<p>At first it seemed as if the mother were right.
In an awed whisper to Dr. Montessori the girl
directress spoke of Otello as “the terrible.” He
met love with apparent hate, kindness with malevolence,
sociability with taciturn aloofness. Did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
little Mario with painstaking effort lay a carpet
of beautifully tinted color spools in careful order
on his table; then Otello swooped down from his
watchful corner and with one sweep of his fat
hand wrought confusion in the beauty. Did a
stone lie, harmless, in the school garden; Otello
found it and used it with dire results. Did Valia,
the toddler, with much toil fill her small wheelbarrow
with a precious load of sticks ready to
trundle it across the playground; Otello intervened,
overturned the barrow, and gloated over
Valia’s tears.</p>

<p>From his first day he showed an amazing inventiveness
along lines of disorder. To tear a
finished picture that his little girl neighbor had
zealously colored, to swoop down upon the heights
of the pink tower whose perfect building some
other baby had just achieved in a patch of sunlight
on the floor and overturn it—these seemed
to be Otello’s most joyful triumphs. And always,
as he planned some act of disorder, he
looked up, expectantly, for the blow, the harsh
command with which the misdirected force of childhood
is so often met by the brute force of the
adult.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>But these never came. Instead, he saw a group
of sympathetic little ones run softly across the
wide spaces of the room to help Mario in rearranging
his color spools. There was no thought
of him, Otello the law breaker, but only the love
of Mario in their hearts. In place of the reproof
that he almost longed for, that he might meet it
with rebellion, he felt the touch of warm lips on
his forehead, and he heard the soft voice of the
directress:</p>

<p>“Ah, Otello, that was <em>wrong</em>.”</p>

<p>There was no other word of blame, no command,
<em>you must not</em>, for him to meet with his
marvelous strength of will and, <em>I shall</em>. He might
choose the thing that was wrong—or——</p>

<p>It was one sweet spring morning in Italy that I
saw the miracle happen to Otello, a morning when
the free breezes from the Roman hills brought
heavy odors of grape and orange blooms and the
birds sang their freedom outside the windows of
the Trionfale Children’s House. Otello sat in a
little white chair in front of a little white table,
suddenly quiet and thinking. He saw, all about
him, other little white chairs and low white tables.
If he wished he might choose another chair; no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
one would insist that he stay in one seat. The
brown linen curtains at the windows rustled pleasantly
with the perfume-laden wind. If Otello
wished he might go out in the playground for a
breath of that wind. No one would prevent him.
In front of him he saw another large room with
a piano and low white cabinets filled with fascinating
Montessori materials, and colored rugs
for spreading on the stone floor, and many babies,
of his own kind, sitting there busily at work. A
child might dash over and spoil the work of a
dozen children at one attack. Or a child might do
a little experimenting himself with these materials
that so engrossed the others. Otello chose the
latter course, and going to one of the cabinets,
he selected one of the solid insets, a long polished
wood frame, into which fit ten fascinatingly smooth
cylinders of varying diameters. Holding the
cylinders by their shining brass knobs, he put them
in their proper places in the frame, took them out,
put them in again a dozen, a score of times. Unconsciously
he was training his sense of touch,
but more than this, he was exercising his conscience
in a new way. A small cylinder refused to
fit in a large hole in the frame; a large cylinder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
could not be forced, no matter how strenuously
he hammered it with his little clenched fist, into a
small hole. Before Otello put each cylinder in its
proper place, he tested it with a larger or smaller
hole.</p>

<p>“Wrong!” he whispered to himself in the first
instance; and,</p>

<p>“Right!” he ejaculated when the good, smooth
little piece of wood dropped out of sight in its
own hole.</p>

<p>After almost three-quarters of an hour of this
will training, for the little child who persists in
a piece of work and completes it is taking the first
steps toward properly directed <em>will</em>, Otello looked
up from his work. Mario, his neighbor, bent over
the color spools again. From the pocket of
Mario’s apron protruded one of the crown jewels
of childhood—a big glass marble. Otello had no
marble. With all the longing of his heart he had
wanted one. Mario bent lower over his color
matching and the shining glass sphere, as if it
were alive, slipped from his pocket, dropped to the
floor, and rolled across to Otello.</p>

<p>With quick stealthiness Otello grasped it in his
eager little fingers. It was <em>his</em> marble now; no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
one had seen him take it; in his little brown palm
it held and scintillated a hundred colors. How
happy it made him to own it; he would slip it into
the hole in his shoe to keep it safe until he reached
home! But, even as he made a hurried movement
to hide his booty, his prisoned soul burst its
cocoon. With one of the rare smiles in his eyes
that one sees in the undying children of Raphael,
Otello ran over to Mario and dropped the marble
in his lap.</p>

<p>Otello had taught himself the right and he had
made the right his happy choice.</p>

<p>The old way of helping Otello, of helping <em>your</em>
child to right action and self-education, was to
command. Yesterday, we said:</p>

<p>“You must do this because I tell you to; this
is right because I say that it is.”</p>

<p>Dr. Montessori gives us a new, a better way
of educating little children. Before we present
her didactic materials to a child, before—even—he
leaves his cradle and his mother’s arms, we
will give the child his birthright of freedom; physical
freedom, mental freedom, moral freedom. The
place of the mother in education, Dr. Montessori
tells us, is that of the “watcher on the mountain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
top.” She observes every action of the child, helps
him to see the difference between right and wrong,
but she leaves him <em>free</em>, that he may train his own
will, make his own choice, educate himself.</p>

<p>How can we help our children to the goodness
that little Otello has found? What had he missed
at home that was supplied to him in the Children’s
House?</p>

<p>The root that is denied space by its earth
mother to stretch and pull and reach does not
grow into a tall, straight tree. The bud, shut off
from its birthright of sunshine and moisture, does
not unfold into perfect flowering. The child who
is choked at home by an artificial environment and
chained by the commands of his parents will develop
into a crooked, blasted man. Dr. Montessori
told me that her first word to American mothers
is this:—</p>

<p>“Free your children.”</p>

<p>Every child is born with an unlimited capacity
for good. His impulse is to do the good thing,
but we so hedge him about with objects which he
must not touch and places which he must not explore
and inaccuracies of speech which confuse his
understanding, that he rebels. With the force of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
a giant, the baby uses his will to break <em>our</em> will.
This is right; he was born as free as air, and we
act as his jailers. Presently, his thwarted will
finds other outlets, and we are confronted with a
little Otello.</p>

<p>We have thought that to “break” a child’s will
was the first step toward giving him self-control.
We say to a child:</p>

<p>“Don’t be capricious!”</p>

<p>“Don’t tell lies!”</p>

<p>He is capricious because we have so often interfered
with his normal child activities, because
they made him dirty, perhaps, or caused a litter
that we thought disorderly. He lies because we
have not explained his world to him, or because he
fears us. Seldom is a child capricious or untruthful
unless we have made him so.</p>

<p>The Montessori directress at the Trionfale Children’s
House, first of all, patiently observed Otello.
At the end of a week’s time she knew more about
him than his mother did, for she had recorded his
height, weight, chest, and cranial development and
had discovered that he needed physical exercise to
help his mental development. We will watch <em>our</em>
children’s bodily growth more carefully than we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
have in the past if we are to be Montessori mothers.</p>

<p>She never commanded the little fellow whose
ears were so deafened with the many commands of
his mother that he found it a psychological impossibility
to obey. Instead she had faith that his
new environment, her careful pointing out of right
and wrong, and the ordered activities brought
about by the Montessori didactic materials would
loose his spirit, which had been like a butterfly
stabbed by the pin of a scientist.</p>

<p>So we will be patient with our babies and watch
them and wait expectantly for the unfolding of
their minds and souls which will surely come if
we supply the opportunity.</p>

<p>Dr. Montessori gives us a new word for the
home and she blots out an old one.</p>

<p>“Why?” is our new word. We will observe
the minutest activity of the home child from its
first month to the time when it leaves the home for
school, asking ourselves the reason for each activity.</p>

<p>“Don’t!” is our blotted-out word. No activity
of a child should be inhibited unless it is morally
<em>wrong</em>.</p>

<p>From babyhood to the age of six years almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
every free movement, every free thought of the
child has a meaning in relation to its bodily and
mental growth. If we suffocate children’s activities,
we suffocate their lives. The good child is
not the quiet, inactive child. The perfect child
is not the child who is nearest like man.</p>

<p>The only way to keep a child still is to teach
him orderly movement. The only way to keep him
from handling our things is to give him educational
things of his own to handle.</p>

<p>It is a more fascinating home occupation than
any which you ever attempted, this Montessori
way of observing your child. He is your own
life flower, a bud, now, but with the power of sure,
beautiful unfolding into bloom. Your part is to
watch the process of this unfolding, and to surround
the child plant with light and nourishment
and <em>freedom</em> for growth.</p>

<p>You thoughtlessly say, “Don’t sit on the floor
and play; you will soil your clothes.”</p>

<p>“Walk faster and keep up with my footsteps
or I will not take you out with me to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Dr. Montessori tells us that the limbs of the
little child are very short in comparison with his
torso and tire quickly from holding up his body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
weight. If his legs are to grow straight and
strong he must follow his own inclination and sit
and lie on the floor when he plays; he must not
be required to keep up with our longer stride in
walking. We were thoughtless when we commanded
<em>don’t</em>. Dr. Montessori shows us the <em>why</em>.
These actions of the child were wrong only from
our standpoint. We have to cleanse soiled clothes;
we think that we have no time to walk slowly.
But in the Children’s Houses no child is ever required
to stay in his small white chair or to keep
his work on his low table. He is free to work on
the floor in any position which makes him physically
comfortable and soft rugs are provided for
this purpose. No Montessori child is commanded
to stay in line and “keep up” when the piano
gives the signal for a march or one of the gay
Italian dance steps. Otello and Mario and Piccola,
the babies, drop out for a few seconds, seating
themselves for a space of rest, and when their
fat legs are ready for more muscular exertion,
they again join the other children.</p>

<p>But this freedom will make my child fickle, lacking
in concentration, you say.</p>

<p>On the contrary, it leads to concentration. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Montessori-trained child who has never been prevented
from doing a thing unless it was wrong
and who has been allowed to carry on any activity
which it chooses; free play with outdoor toys,
the Montessori physical exercises, sense-training,
drawing, suddenly arrives, at five or six years at
a most unusual amount of concentration. From
a free choice of occupations that lead to the exercise
of the muscles and the senses, the minds
of these little children order themselves, and the
children are able to concentrate on one line of
thought for long periods.</p>

<p>In the Children’s House of one of the Model
Tenements in Rome, I saw a little girl come quietly
in at nine o’clock, button on her apron, and seat
herself with a book. She read, happily, for three-quarters
of an hour, hardly lifting her eyes from
the pages, although twenty-five other little ones
were carrying on almost as many different occupations
all about her. At the end of this time, she
closed her book, crossed to the blackboard, looked
out of the window a moment, and wrote in a clear
hand the following childish idyl to the day:</p>

<p>“The sun shines,” it began. “I smell the
orange flowers and the sky is blue and I hear birds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
singing. I am happy because it is a pleasant day.”</p>

<p>Do we find such concentration in our children
whom we teach according to rule and in masses?
We have thought that to educate was to formulate
a great many rules and make our little ones follow
them, but our new Montessori ideal is a very different
matter—that of leaving Life free to develop
and to unfold.</p>

<p>The American child has the strongest will, his
gift from a vital heredity, of any child in the
world. His father and his mother have, also,
this splendidly forceful inherited will. Parent and
child tilt and bout in a daily fight, and if the parent
comes out triumphant and succeeds in breaking
the child’s will there is a deadly wrong done. That
is why our reform schools and prisons are so full
of strong wills, beyond bending.</p>

<p>We must let our little ones blaze their own
trails, provided, of course, that they are trails
which lead in the right direction. We must, also,
let them make their own decisions, and if occasionally
they prove to have been wrong, the experience
will have helped them to decide wisely
the next time. We will, also, put into their hands
the self-corrective didactic apparatus of Montessori,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
which has a distinct ethical value in the
training of the human will.</p>

<p>Education to be vivid and permanent in the
child’s life should be worked out along lines of
experience. To say to a child, “Don’t do that;
it isn’t right,” is to make a very inadequate appeal
to one, only, of his senses, that of hearing.
To put into the child’s hands the blocks of the
Montessori tower so carefully graded in dimension
that it takes exquisite differentiation to pile them
is to give him a chance to learn through experience
the difference between right and wrong by
means of three senses. He hears a possible direction
as to their use, he touches them, he sees the
perfectly completed tower. In like manner the
broad and long stair, the solid and geometric
insets, all contribute their quota to the sum of
the child’s perfectly directed will control.</p>

<p>The average home is full of mediums for helping
a little child to develop along lines of willed
control. To concentrate upon a bit of constructive
play until it is finished, to learn orderliness in
putting away playthings, or to do some simple
home duty that will be carried over from day to
day, all are important willed activities. To do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
whatever is in hand, building or drawing or picking
up toys, or bathing or caring for a doll or
a pet, or helping mother as well as possible, is,
also, very vital will-training.</p>

<p>Dr. Montessori helps us to a hopeful outlook
on the subject of child will. Our Otellos are not,
after all, terrible. The child who is most difficult
to manage is, with Montessori training, the child
who turns out to be best able to manage himself.</p>

<p>When Bruno was a little fellow, his mother
and father were killed in the Messina earthquake.</p>

<p>Because he was one of so many left-behind
babies, he was quite neglected, and he grew up
to four years as a weed grows. Sometimes one
<i lang="it">madre</i> of the tenement mothered him, sometimes
not. At times he was fed, at other times he
starved. Because of the great fear that came to
him with the blinding smoke and the twisting red
river of molten lava and the death cry of his girl
mother that day of the earthquake, Bruno’s mind
seemed a bit dulled. He was often confused by
the commands of people who tried to take care of
him and so could not obey. Then they would
strike him. And he heard very vile language
spoken and he saw very evil things done during
his babyhood in the tenement.</p>

<p>When Bruno wandered across the threshold of
the Via Giusti Children’s House in Rome, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
seemed like a little alien among the other happy
little ones who were so carefully watched over, so
gently led. For days he sat in silence, his great,
frightened blue eyes watching to help him dodge
the blow that he expected but never felt; his lips
ready to imitate the vile speech that he had known
before, but which he never heard here. His timid
fingers fumbled with the big pink and blue letters
that the other children used in making long sentences
on the floor; they tried to button, to lace,
to match colors, but not very effectually. It was
as if the great fear of his babyhood had shadowed
his whole mental life and left him powerless.</p>

<p>One morning Bruno’s dulled blue eyes glimpsed
an unusual stir among the children. A new little
one had come and, full of disorderly impulses,
had snatched at the varicolored carpet of carefully
arranged color spools Piccola had placed
on her table, scattering them to the floor. Red,
green, orange, yellow, Piccola’s painstaking work
of an hour lay in a great, colored, mixed-up heap.
Piccola’s eyes, still pools that reflected all the hazel
tints of fall woods, grew blurred with tears. She
dropped her curly head in her arms and sobbed,
big, gulping sobs that wouldn’t stop, that strangled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
her. Bruno, watching her, found his muscles.
He ran to her, putting one kind little arm around
her waist, and with the other drew her head down
to the shoulder of his little ragged blue blouse
and smoothed her hair, talking sweet, liquid nonsense
all the time that made Piccola’s sobs grow
less and less, and comforted her. When she smiled
and drew away to watch the group of children
who had hurried to pick up her colors for her,
Bruno slipped back to his corner and the old,
dull look settled back in his face.</p>

<p>“The little man has the conscience sense. He
shall have a chance to use it,” thought the Montessori
directress who had been watching the scene.</p>

<p>And because she wanted his soul to grow strong,
even if his timid fingers couldn’t, she often stopped
by Bruno’s chair to hold his hand, kindly, for
a minute in hers, or just bent over him, smiling
straight down into his face.</p>

<p>“No one will hurt this little man of ours. He
loves us and we love him,” she assured Bruno over
and over, until one day her patience reaped the
prize of Bruno’s answering smile and she felt his
two hungry little arms clasping her.</p>

<p>She strengthened his beginning friendship with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Piccola, the color-loving, reckless, daring little
maid, whom all the children loved to love and loved
to fight. When Piccola brought an unusual treat
in her luncheon basket, a leaf-wrapped packet of
dried grapes or two luscious figs instead of one,
the directress suggested that she share with Bruno,
who had no one to tuck a surprise in his basket.
As the two child faces drew close above the feast
and the little hands fluttered together over this
friendly breaking of bread, Bruno’s eyes sparkled.
He was reading his first lines in the primer of
love; he was finding his sight. And in return
Bruno helped Piccola to rake leaves in the garden,
he unrolled and carefully spread upon the floor the
rug upon which Piccola wished to curl herself and
sort letters; he hastened to add his strength to
hers when the drawer that held the letters stuck;
he fought Piccola’s street battles for her.</p>

<p>Soon Bruno’s loving busy-ness so increased that
he found things to do almost every second of his
happy days in the Children’s House. No longer
the little cowering, cringing, inactive child of a
few weeks past, he was an alert little man whom
I instantly watched, because his activity was so
unusual. When the line of children, two by two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
and clasping hands, in their pretty custom of welcoming
visitors to the Via Giusti Children’s House,
tumbled in each morning, Bruno always headed
the line. He held by the hand the smallest, newest,
or the most timid child, dragging it in his
eagerness to teach it to shake hands and say
good-day. He would “hold up” the line because
he had so much to say in his welcome to the
strangers who had come to spend the morning with
the little ones.</p>

<p>“See our Signorina; is she not <em>kind</em>?</p>

<p>“This is our room; do you like it?</p>

<p>“There is Margherita; she <em>writes</em>!</p>

<p>“This is Piccola, who reads!”</p>

<p>In breathless sentences, Bruno’s heart interest
worded itself. Then, as the others settled themselves
for the day’s work, Bruno began his day
of service. He was the Loving One, the Helping
One, the Comforting One of the Via Giusti Children’s
House. Was any child left without a glass
of water at the luncheon hour, Bruno fetched it.
Did the little girl waitress for the day forget to
fill a soup plate from her tureen, Bruno reminded
her. If the three-year-old started home
with his cloak unbuttoned, Bruno, feeling in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
tender little heart the chill wind of the Roman
hills, buttoned the cloak for the baby. If a toddler
tumbled down, Bruno picked it up and examined
it for bumps, and started it safely on its
way again. He fetched and carried, watched for
chances to help, to champion the weak, to wipe
away anybody’s tears with the hem of his
apron.</p>

<p>The seat he most often chose was under a cast
of the Madonna. Sometimes he sat quiet for
long spaces, looking at it. “Bruno calls the Madonna
his <i lang="it">madre</i>,” whispered Piccola one day.</p>

<p>“Who is that big, homely child?” asked a
visitor, pointing to Bruno putting fresh water in
a bowl of roses that stood under the cast. “Isn’t
he older than the other children?”</p>

<p>“Older—yes, in spirit,” answered the far-seeing
directress. “He is our little Christ-child.”</p>

<p>So he is <em>our</em> little Christ-child. Wherever there
is a child in a home, Dr. Montessori tells us, there
Christ is. She discovers for us a new sense, the
“conscience sense,” only waiting for an opportunity
to exercise itself and, in the exercising, unfold
and bloom and ripen into the fruits of the
spirit. If being an orphan and hungry and beaten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
and knowing vile things couldn’t hurt the soul of
Bruno, think of the possibility of Christ in <em>your</em>
baby.</p>

<p>Children grow, mentally, through the right exercise
of the senses. To see and to be able to distinguish
between beautiful colors and beautiful
forms; to discriminate between sounds that are discordant
and sounds that are harmonious; to know
rough things and smooth things, round things and
square things, velvet things and linen things, by
touching them with the finger tips, this we know
is a starting point on the road of the three R’s
of everyday education. Dr. Montessori guides us
a lap farther in the new education. She sees, born
with every child, eyes of the spirit and slender,
groping fingers of the soul that look and reach
for the good. To help a child to use his spirit
eyes and his soul fingers means to give him a chance
to exercise his conscience. It is a new sort of
sense-training that means his finding the three
R’s of the life of the spirit: faith, hope, and
charity.</p>

<p>How shall we help a child to exercise and train
his <em>conscience sense</em>?</p>

<p>Dr. Montessori tells us that if we but watch a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
little child’s free, spontaneous use of his soul fingers,
his daily loves and hopes and faith, these will
shine for us as a Bethlehem star-path leading us
to the manger-throne of a King-in-the-making.
As we are turning a child’s tendency to <em>handle</em> into
mind-training, we will turn his manifestations of
inner sensibility into morality.</p>

<p>It is quite ineffectual to say to a child:</p>

<p>“You must love your neighbor.”</p>

<p>Of course he will try to do the thing that we
ask of him because he is a very kind little person,
ready to put up with the inconsistencies of his
elders and willing to try to obey; but it will be a
makeshift sort of love, not free and a flowering of
the child’s own heart, but built upon what we tell
him about love. This makes of children little
puppets.</p>

<p>Dr. Montessori says: “Watch <em>how</em> children
love and <em>what</em> they love.”</p>

<p>You know <em>how</em> your child loves—with the
thoughtless abandon of pure passion. That he
interferes with your important occupation, crumples
your immaculateness, has a soiled face and
sticky fingers when he kisses you, do not enter into
his thoughts. That anything should interfere with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
his caresses would wound his heart. If you were
disfigured or maimed, he would still vision you as
the beautiful mother whom baby eyes see only
with the eyes of adoration.</p>

<p>Is this a love that we can teach?</p>

<p>You know <em>what</em> your child loves. There was
the ugly yellow puppy with muddy feet that
stained your new rug; don’t you remember how
the Little Chap sobbed so long, and then woke up
in the night crying, the day you sent away the
yellow puppy? He loved, too, the dirty rag doll
that you burned and the broken toy that you
threw away, and that little street gamin of a
newsboy who stands at the corner in all kinds
of weather. He doesn’t love ceremony and money
and the opinions of other people as we do. The
Little Chap goes out into the highways and byways
for his stuff of love. And he doesn’t care if the
thing he loves is ugly, or old, or halt, or lame,
because he sees, with his soul eyes, behind the veil
of appearances to the <em>real of it</em>.</p>

<p>Your child is born with faith and hope, too. If
you tell him that the moon is made of green
cheese and that a stork dropped him down the
chimney, he believes you, and when he grows up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
and catches you in the lies, he has one less peg
in his moral inner room to pin his faith in the
divine to. If you tell him that you will take him
to the circus, and then let your bridge party interfere
with that promise, the Little Chap is going to
be less hopeful that God will keep His promises,
for you stand for the divine in the Little Chap’s
beginnings of spirituality.</p>

<p>Dr. Montessori says that we often crush the
child’s conscience sense by not giving him an opportunity
to exercise it as he is led to, instinctively.
We must let our children, in their baby
days, love <em>as</em> they wish and <em>what</em> they wish. We
must be quite careful to give them true conceptions
of the strange world in which they find themselves,
and we must make only good promises to
children and use much vigilance in keeping those
promises.</p>

<p>Dr. Montessori sets another guidepost for us
in the star-path by which our children will travel
across the desert of unbelief to the manger where
God, incarnate, lies. She tells us that, as the Ten
Commandments were a very simple set of laws for
the Israelites, and John, in his preaching of simplicity,
paved the way for Christ, so the first religious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
teaching of the little child should have this
same quality of directness.</p>

<p><em>The child’s first religious training will consist
in a discrimination between good and evil.</em></p>

<p>“It was good of you to share your sweets with
sister. When you ate your chocolate, alone,
yesterday, I was sorry, because it was selfish.”</p>

<p>“It was thoughtful of you to fetch grandfather’s
cane for him. Some little boys would not have
been so kind.”</p>

<p>“You must not scream and kick when you are
angry. It is wrong!”</p>

<p>We might say in contrast; we do, ordinarily,
say:</p>

<p>“You must share because I wish you to.”</p>

<p>“You must be kind because the world likes gentlemen.”</p>

<p>“You mustn’t scream and kick, because you give
me a headache and mar my furniture.”</p>

<p>Such commands are quite ineffectual, because
they call the child’s attention to us and not to
his own acts. But patiently and effectually to
see that the Little Chap knows the difference between
good and evil and practices good instead
of evil—this gives him a chance to train and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
strengthen his conscience sense and forms the beginnings
of his moral life.</p>

<p>“But how shall I give my child an idea of God?”
thousands of thinking parents object.</p>

<p>It isn’t necessary to give the idea of God to
your child. Dr. Montessori tells us that <em>every
child has it</em>.</p>

<p>We think that we must do so much teaching in
order to educate the little child’s mind, or his
soul. In fact we need to do less teaching than
watching, less pruning than watering. After observing
our little ones’ spontaneous manifestations
of love and giving these a chance to increase, and
meeting them with encouragement after conscientiously
pointing out to them the good and the evil
of life and insisting that they choose the good
and reject the evil—we discover a miracle. God
comes to the little ones.</p>

<p>Bruno, starved in his mind and starved in his
heart, and never having heard of things of the
spirit except in terms of the vilest blasphemy,
found God as naturally as he would find the first
gold blossom of the broom braving winter’s frosts
on the Appian Way.</p>

<p>Our own Helen Keller, deaf and dumb and blind,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
knew God before anything that her teacher could
tell her about Him had pierced the dark wall of
her sleeping senses.</p>

<p>Dr. Montessori asks us to prepare the way for
this miracle in our homes. She says that she
would like to suggest to mothers a new beatitude,
“Blessed are those who <em>feel</em>;” and we add,</p>

<p>For they find God.</p>

<h2 id="MARIOS_FINGER_EYES">MARIO’S FINGER EYES<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Montessori Sense-Training</i></span></h2>

<p>Your little one, Mario, might have been, big
eyes instantly glancing a bit of color, something
that moved, something that could be handled or
broken. All his four years he had been fighting
his mother, his home, the world—a one-sided fight,
too, for everybody and everything always triumphed
over him in the end. He was so little and
so ineffectual to do battle.</p>

<p>And the times when he had been punished for
breaking his mother’s cherished plates with the
pattern of raised roses—plump and red—for
clutching in loving, chubby, grimy hands the soft
silk window curtains or the bright velvet table-cover
could not be counted. Yet Mario was cheerful and
uncowed and continued the struggle, the
impulse for which had been born with him, to use
his fingers in learning about the world of <em>things</em>.</p>

<p>To check this impulse was the object of everyone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
who had anything to do with little Mario.
There was his grandmother in a wonderful silk
headdress and a yellow wool shawl, fringed; she
would not let Mario clutch the cap and then feel
of the shawl, as his fingers itched to. There was
the old fruit man at the corner near Mario’s
house; he shook a stick at children who handled
his round and square measures, his fruits, and
vegetables of so many different shapes. There
was always his <i lang="it">madre</i>, who pursued Mario from
waking to sleeping time, interfering with his activities.</p>

<p>“Mario, don’t run your fingers along the window
ledge; don’t handle the door latch. You will
soil them. You must not play with copper bowls
and pots; they are for cooking, not for little
boys.”</p>

<p>As the warfare continued, Mario grew bolder.
To be stopped when one is playing with a fruit
measure or a door latch or a bright, red copper
bowl with no malicious designs upon these but
only to satisfy a sense of hunger for knowledge
of form, hurt his spirit.</p>

<p>“I <em>will</em>,” he announced one day, when his grandmother
tried to rescue her cap from his deft fingering,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
and he pulled off one of the long, silken
streamers.</p>

<p>“I will <em>not</em>,” he further asserted when his
mother wished the copper pot to cook her beans,
and when she tried to take it from him forcibly,
Mario stamped and shrieked and struck his <i lang="it">madre</i>.</p>

<p>The habit of saying “I will” or “I won’t”
in situations that demand the will to decide, “I
won’t” or “I will” is an easy habit for a little
child to form and a most dangerous one, morally.
It is seldom a self-formed but a parent-stimulated
habit. When his mother put Mario, for reformation
and “to get rid of him,” in The House of
the Children at the Trionfale School in Rome,
it was with the assurance:</p>

<p>“He’s a bad little boy. He never does what
he ought to; he’s always in mischief.”</p>

<p>“What should be a little child’s ‘oughts’ the
first years of life? Isn’t what we call getting into
mischief, perhaps, the big business of childhood?”
we asked ourselves as we watched Mario in his
Montessori development. So, at least, Mario’s
teacher decided.</p>

<p>“Go as you please, do as you wish, play with
whatever you like—only be careful not to hurt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the work or the body of any other little one,”
were the words that turned Mario’s struggles to
educate himself into a joy instead of a fight.</p>

<p>Sitting in the light of the Roman sunshine and
the smiles of the other children of the Children’s
House, Mario began to do the thing he was born
for in babyhood—he began to <em>see with his fingers</em>.</p>

<p class="caption">Building the tower and the broad stair.</p>
</div>

<p>I watched him for days, such a blessedly good,
chubby, curly-headed little man that my arms
ached to hold him, instead of leaving him free to
trot from one occupation to another, busy, concentrated,
educating himself. Mario’s mother, his
wise old grandmother, the canny fruit seller,—none
of them had known how blurred the world
looks to the eyes of a little child. Many mothers
are not able to see with the eyes of a child. We
grown-ups who comprehend a beautiful landscape,
a lovely fresco, a piece of miracle machinery, a
fragile porcelain vase, a statue, an immortal pile
of architecture instantaneously, analyzing the
form that makes the beauty, never stop to think
how we grasp it, mentally. It is the color and
curve of the landscape, the combination of lines
in the fresco, the “feel” and contour of the
statue, the “fit” of the machinery, the design of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
the vase, the combination of geometric figures in
the building, that make the beauty. The artist,
the inventor, the sculptor, the architect, saturated
their finger tips, then their eyes, and last
their brains with a knowledge of line and form
before they saw Fame reaching out her hands to
touch theirs. Every little child is born with a
longing to <em>feel</em> line and form, not perhaps for
Fame’s, but for Knowledge’s sake, and we crush
the longing when we say “don’t touch.”</p>

<p>Intent, engrossed Mario worked for days until
he grew expert in piling, one upon the other, the
graded, rose-colored blocks of the Montessori
Tower. Soon he could erect the tower, blindfolded.
Just a fascinating play it looked, as interesting
as is the play of our babies with their
nested picture blocks, but it was play with a
purpose. It taught Mario to <em>feel</em> and then to
discriminate, mentally, between objects that differ
in dimension, one from another.</p>

<p>Then came the fun of laying in order the graded
blocks of the Montessori Broad Stair. Building
steps, it was, as all home children instinctively
struggle to build steps with their blocks, with
dominoes, with pebbles and rocks of different sizes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>Why do children like to build steps; is it not because
they live in a world of <em>high</em> and <em>low</em>, and
<em>higher</em> and <em>lower</em> things? We grown-ups say, “It
is a beautiful sky-line, the tall and low buildings
rubbing shoulders,” or “The clouds are banked
in a red and gold mass.” How did we learn the
beauty of gradation of form in a city, in nature?
Once when we were as little as Mario we tried
to build stairs, we jumped, happily, from one
step to another; we climbed, we learned height
and depth by <em>feeling</em> them. So, Mario learned
to see minute variations in the height of objects
through the broad stair.</p>

<p>He spent hours fitting the little wooden cylinders
in their places in their frames. How he had
longed to play with the vases and jugs at home,
some tall and some short, some thick and some
thin. And how many times his mother had prevented
his digging rows of little holes in the garden
in which to fit, first, a fat thumb, then a slim
forefinger; last, a tiny finger! With the Montessori
geometric insets, he could enjoy this hole
play, and, at the same time, learn, through <em>feeling</em>,
to recognize very fine differences in height
and breadth. One day Mario found a little set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
of drawers in the big white material cupboard at
the Montessori School. It made him remember
his grandmother’s great shelf of drawers with the
polished brass knobs. In these were hidden fascinating,
musty-smelling wool shawls, silk scarfs,
soft embroideries, and stiff, bright ribbons.
Mario’s secret happiness had been to climb upon
a stool, clutch a brass knob, pull, and then delve
pink fingers into the sense-feeding horde of stuffs.
He would close his eyes and enjoy the <em>feel</em> of them,
but there was always the rude awakening.</p>

<p>“Naughty Mario—don’t touch.” But now he
had these other drawers full of stuffs to open, to
empty, to sort the contents, to crumple the stuffs
in his hands, and then match velvet to velvet, silk
to silk, wool to wool, blindfolded. It hadn’t been
shawls and scarfs and embroideries and ribbons
that the little man wanted, but a chance to use
his fingers in learning to recognize the qualities
of objects; rough, soft, smooth, stiff.</p>

<p>Otello brought a great, crimson poppy to the
Children’s House one day. Poppies to the Roman
baby are as dandelions to our children, so lavish
a gift of the nature mother as to be of little value
after the first bloom colors the grass. Otello’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
impulse was to pull off the already dropping
petals of the flower, but Mario rescued it from
the ruthless baby fingers. Holding the fragile
stem between forefinger and chubby thumb, he ran
the other forefinger lightly over the surface of
the velvet-soft petals of the poppy. Then he ran
to baby Valia and touched her leaf-soft cheek with
the finger that taught him how like a flower petal
in softness is the flesh of a child.</p>

<p>It was so daily an application of newly-gained
knowledge as to be unnoticed save by a wondering
onlooker. It was the mind enrichment through
sense-training denied Mario by his home and offered
him by Montessori.</p>

<img src="images/illus9.jpg" width="350" height="500" alt="" />
<p class="caption">A fineness of perception is developed by discriminating
different textiles blindfolded.</p>
</div>

<p>The frames for geometric insets enthralled
Mario next. To take out of its place, fit in again,
and refit a dozen, twenty times the different sizes
of flat wooden circles, squares, triangles, rectangles,
and other forms kept the little fingers busy
and the opening mind concentrated for long
spaces. The wooden insets are large, shining with
polish, and easy to handle because of the brass
knob attached to each. As Mario lifted one out
of its place in the form board, he ran his fingers
around the edge, then around the empty place in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
the board. Soon he could do this with closed eyes,
fitting wooden figures of many different shapes
and sizes correctly in the form board. He
matched these forms to corresponding paper
forms mounted on cards and then to outlined
forms.</p>

<p>Here was a circle like the top of the red copper
bowl, and a smaller circle like the top of the yellow
majolica mug that held his milk in the morning.
Here was a rectangle like the kitchen window at
home and a triangle like the glittering one the
band man struck to make music. Kitchen utensils
and home furnishings and the street band are as
vastly interesting to all children as they were to
little Mario, interesting because they are things
of color and texture and shape and sound.</p>

<p>One morning Mario showed his teacher one of
the rectangular geometric insets. “The window
in the church,” he explained. Then he picked
up a rectangular inset. “This is like the flower-bed
in the Gardens,” he announced.</p>

<p>Your child struggles to educate himself through
his senses as did Mario. You, too, perhaps, not
seeing the inspiration in the active little fingers,
say, “He gets into mischief all the time.” It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
our privilege to turn child mischief into education.
Instead of taking away from children the
objects which they select for handling, we must
study those objects and substitute for them didactic
materials for education of the tactile sense,
the sense of weight, the sense of form and contour.</p>

<p>A little girl whose spirit is so sensitively attuned
that a breath, almost, will snap the too-taut
strings was allowed to be present at a dinner her
mother was giving. Through a wearisome round
of courses, the little one sat in her uncomfortable
chair, quiet, good, and tracing with one finger the
design of her cut-glass tumbler. Sometimes the
blue eyes closed as she tried to retrace the design
in the air or on the table linen. At last her mother
saw what she was doing.</p>

<p>“Leave the table immediately!” she commanded.
“You are a very impolite child.”</p>

<p>She thought that she was a good mother, but
the tear-brimming eyes of the little one, disgraced,
hurt, should have mirrored her cruelty. We can’t
allow children to finger cut glass, but we ought
to furnish them with a substitute for sense-training
that will remove the necessity.</p>

<p>Our children are born into a world of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
they know nothing. They are discoverers, travelers
touching an unknown shore, and the first
business of their new-found life is to adjust themselves
to their environment. Like valiant explorers
they plunge into the wilderness in which
they find themselves. We furnish them with food
and clothing for the journey, but we have quite
neglected to offer them at the beginning any chart
or compass.</p>

<p>Because of this, the way of a child of two and
a half to four years is a stumbling way in our
homes. He is hedged in by a wilderness of furnishings
and bric-à-brac and household appliances
and mechanical devices and different kinds of materials
and strange forms and varied colors. It
is the business of being a child to notice and handle
and smell and test and use these different objects,
but we continually thwart him in his attempts to
make these social adjustments. In so doing we
turn the child into a militant instead of a discoverer.
He must conquer his wilderness. Prevented
from learning through the medium of his
senses, he fights to learn, and we say that he is
destructive and wilful and lacking in thoughtfulness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Montessori offers our children in the didactic
material for sense-training a valuable guide
for adjusting himself to his environment. The
solid insets, the tower, the broad and long stair
teach him through his own experiment and discovery
the qualities which all the objects in his
world possess; height, breadth, length, thickness
in all their combinations and gradations. The
color spools give him a chance to recognize and
learn practically all the various tints and shades
that surround him in his colorful world. The
geometric insets bring to him, through his senses
of touch and vision, the many and wonderful combinations
of line with line and with curves which
constitute the form of the world. By means of
the Montessori textiles and other appliances for
exercising the sense of touch, he learns to detect
and discriminate the most minute gradations of
softness and roughness, smoothness and coarseness.
The Montessori sense-training apparatus
guides the child on his spiritual trip through his
environment.</p>

<p>It is the guide, however, for the very young
child whose senses are hungry. We are so used
to waiting on our one, two, and three-year-old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
babies; we are so busy taking out of their hands
our own precious belongings and substituting for
them a toy, that the Montessori idea of guiding
children, mentally, from the cradle, is strange to
us. The average five or six-year-old child completes
the Montessori sense-training quickly.
What next? we ask.</p>

<p>To be able to, blindfolded, fit a polished wood
rectangle in a corresponding rectangular frame
is, to the minds of some of us, the climax of a
Montessori exercise. To Montessori herself it is
only the beginning of education in form; we must
help the child to see, feel, recognize form in various
combinations; to draw, to love as pure form
in the world about him as he has learned with
this geometric inset. The Montessori sense-training
appliances should be used as the genetic psychologist
uses his various instruments and mental
tests. They are to arouse and awake into activity
habits of quick perception, keen appreciation, and
constructive invention.</p>

<p>The greatest thing we can do for a child is to
so educate it that it <em>knows its environment</em> and
can <em>adjust itself to social conditions</em>. We do this
when we teach our children to see, to hear, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
touch intelligently. The lure of the senses is a
spiritual spell in childhood. If we catch it, then,
and turn it into channels of knowledge, we may
develop a Marconi, conqueror of space; a Rodin,
conqueror of form; a Burbank, conqueror of life—a
Carrel, conqueror of death. At least we will
have developed an observer who knows how to
use his senses in the practical living of life.</p>

<h2 id="RAFFAELOS_HUNGER">RAFFAELO’S HUNGER<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Color Teaching. Its Value</i></span></h2>

<p>Raffaelo’s grandfather had been a shepherd
in the Roman hills, not so much because he liked
to tend the dull, white creatures, but on account
of the blue roof beneath which he sat all day and
the carpet of green splashed with poppy crimson
and primrose gold and lupin blue that lay at his
feet, and the sunset that he waited for every
night. It was never the same, that sunset; like
a beautiful Roman ribbon it spread itself before
his eyes, and he would rather see it than go home
to eat.</p>

<p>Tucked under his long, wool cloak, he carried
a pigment-daubed palette and a patch of canvas.
As the lambs and their mothers grazed, he watched,
hungrily, for picture stuff: a bright yellow cart
taking its slow way along the white dust of the
Via Appia, the flower girl walking in to Rome
with her arms full of roses, the gold edges of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
distant wheat field—these fed his soul and satisfied
his hunger.</p>

<p>Because the State was blind and thought that
to fight is more vital than to paint beautiful
pictures, the grandfather of Raffaelo was forced
into the Italian army. The day that they substituted
a gun for his crook and threw away his
palette, they killed his soul. The grandfather of
Raffaelo made a very poor soldier, indeed.
The little boy that he left at home on the Campagna
grew up, and was a poor soldier, too;
and when he had finished military service
he married and went to live in a tenement in
Rome, and in due time little Raffaelo was
born.</p>

<p>It was all quite commonplace, and like the story
of many other families. But it had, too, its element of
the unusual. With those long-ago, shepherding
days on the Roman Campagna, a gnawing
hunger had begun. It wasn’t a body hunger,
but a hunger of the spirit. It killed the body
of the grandfather of Raffaelo—spirit hunger
is more destructive than a hunger for bread.
Down through the years it took its gnawing way.
It killed the youth in the father of Raffaelo and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
it took possession of him in the gray streets of
the city and stifled his manhood.</p>

<p>Then the hunger pierced the spirit of little
Raffaelo, and that was where it stopped—a cruel,
unsatiated thing. With the gathered strength of
all those years, it starved the baby.</p>

<p>He couldn’t have explained in words just what
he was hungry for. In fact he couldn’t explain
anything very well, being not quite three years
old. Only, he was continually unsatisfied when
he looked at the ugliness of the dull walls of his
home, and when his mother took him along the
hard, gray streets of the city he tugged and pulled
at her hand whenever he passed a corner flower
stand, or a cart piled high with a mass of colored
vegetables.</p>

<p>Raffaelo was beauty hungry, as his father had
been and his grandfather. And no one knew it;
and no one would have cared if they had known.</p>

<p>No one?</p>

<p>Little Raffaelo trudged across the court one
morning to the Children’s House in the Scuola
Famagosta, near which he lived, and there found
a kind welcome and a happy, busy community of
children like himself. Neat, in his clean apron,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
and with big, questioning eyes, he sat apart from
the others in one corner of the room, watching.
Certain of the children were writing big, plain
script on the blackboard; others sat quietly reading
to themselves from big picture books. Raffaelo’s
glance shifted from these to a child who
stood near him, working at a low table. What
had he brought from the white shelves in that big
wooden box? Raffaelo wondered. Why was he
turning the box over? But the table was suddenly
covered with a mass of color, such as only the
Romans know how to dye. From the box came
reel upon reel of ravishingly colored silks, every
color that tints sky and field and garden—crimson,
orange, lemon, the deep green of the grass,
and the gray green of the olive leaf; the blue that
makes wild iris and children’s eyes, the purple
of grapes when the sun shines on the vineyards.
If Raffaelo could have counted, he would have
known that there were sixty-four of these flat,
white wooden spools, wound with eight colors and
eight of each color, showing almost all the grading
of color that makes this old earth of ours
so lovely.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;" id="illus11">
<img src="images/illus11.jpg" width="500" height="400" alt="" />
<p class="caption">To match the colors two by two is the first exercise.</p>
</div>

<p>The colors trickled like a life-giving stream into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Raffaelo’s starved senses. He reached for the
color spools, snatching a great fistful away from
the other child.</p>

<p>“<i lang="it">Mio; mio!</i> Me; me!” he cried.</p>

<p>They <em>were</em> his. Some of us steal bread when
we are hungry. Some of us steal love when we
are famished for it. Children steal because we
or the world have starved them of something
which they crave for their natural, best development
of body, mind, or soul. The habitual public
school teacher, the average mother of to-day,
would have said:</p>

<p>“Give those colors back. It’s wicked to take
something that is not yours!”</p>

<p>The directress of this Montessori school, in
which teaching and mothering are practiced in
new ways, watched Raffaelo for a moment, asking
herself:</p>

<p>“Why does this child steal? Is he blind to
law because his need is so great?”</p>

<p>Then she crossed to Raffaelo, bringing with
her a handful of color spools—two red, two blue,
two yellow.</p>

<p>“These are yours,” she said. “Will you give
your little neighbor’s colors back to him, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
it was not right to take them? When you have
carried to him every one of the spools, return to
me and I will tell you about <em>your</em> colors.”</p>

<p>Happily, Raffaelo did as he was told, receiving
his first lesson in ethics before he had his first
color lesson. Returning, he stood, wide-eyed and
fascinated, beside the directress as she held out to
him two of the color spools.</p>

<p>“This is <em>red</em>,” she explained, laying the red
spool on the white table in front of him, and
waiting a moment or two, that he might make
the mental association between the name of the
color and the color itself. Then she showed him
a blue wound spool.</p>

<p>“This is <em>blue</em>,” she said, laying his spool at
the opposite side of the table from the red one,
and again waiting for Raffaelo to make the association
of name and color. Taking the next step
in this Montessori teaching, she pointed to the
red wound spool, and asked:</p>

<p>“What is this, Raffaelo?”</p>

<p>“Red,” he laughed back.</p>

<p>“And this?” pointing to the other one.</p>

<p>“Blue!” Raffaelo almost shouted in his delight
at acquiring knowledge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>Then came the last step in Raffaelo’s lesson.
Holding out the remaining tablets in the palm of
her hand, the directress said:</p>

<p>“Show me red, Raffaelo. And show me blue.”</p>

<p>With no mistake, the little color lover selected
the red, the blue, and placed each on his table,
matching them to the corresponding spools.</p>

<p>“These are yellow,” the directress explained
to him, giving him the two remaining spools. Then
she left him, having given him the food for clear,
colorful thought for which two generations of
thwarted painters had made him long.</p>

<p>All the morning Raffaelo played with his six
color spools, gathering them together into a pile,
handling them, holding them up to the light, that
he might watch the play of sunshine and shade
upon their beauty, pairing them upon his table,
repeating to himself: “Red, blue, yellow!” Sometimes
he watched his small neighbor, who had
grown very expert in color lore and could name
all the colors and lay the spools in chromatic
order on his table, eight rows headed, severally,
by black, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet,
and brown, and each row containing eight gradations
of its color.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>When this child completed his series of orderly
color scales he went to the window and looked out
at the Roman hill rising back of the school. To
the child who had not received Montessori color
teaching, the hill would have been a shapeless,
colorless bit of earth. To this child, who could
see color in its finest gradation, it was a landscape
where one could trace the gold outline of orange
and lemon, the red tiling of a vine-tender’s house
near the top and back of it a sky that was violet—not
blue. He looked at the hill for a long time.
Then he selected an outlined picture of a tree,
and looking intently at a box of colored pencils,
selected one that was just the color of a cedar
and proceeded to fill in the outline.</p>

<p class="caption">All the colors of nature may be found.</p>
</div>

<p>To Raffaelo, the child was a spellworker.
Watching this fascination, the directress gave Raffaelo
a box of color spools, emptying them out
and allowing him to try and differentiate the
colors, putting each back in its right compartment
in the box. She did not burden his mind with
names. He was feeding his senses by just handling
and feeling the colors, and he was unspeakably
happy. When the noon hour came, he did
not want to go home. When his bedtime came,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
that night, he escaped from his mother and ran
to the window, looking out. The night before, he
had looked down at the soiled, unbeautiful street;
to-night he looked up. The sun was just setting,
a ruby ball in a sea of amber.</p>

<p>“See!” Raffaelo shouted, pointing to the sunset.
“Red; yellow!”</p>

<p>As his mother picked him up and carried him
away from the window, he looked deep down into
her eyes. “Blue,” he said, seeing them for the
first time in all their beauty. The hunger of Raffaelo
was fed.</p>

<p>Every child is color hungry. Your child may
be a painter in the making, heir to a century-old
talent that somebody had to bury, but which would
not die and rose and haunted. Or he may be an
average child who will be happier and better all
his life if he can see each fine gradation of color
that tints the sunset and can feed his soul on a
beautiful Titian or a Fra Angelico.</p>

<p>We have thought that we were teaching our
children color when we called their attention to
a colored object. A child is much more apt to
associate taste with the apple which we show him
when we try to give him a color lesson, and quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
possibly we make a false statement when we say
that the apple is red. Very few apples are <em>red</em>;
they are dark red, light red, orange, or yellow
in tint. Why not begin the other way round, as
Dr. Montessori does, and teach pure <em>color</em>, giving
the child the joy that comes from discovering for
himself just what pigment nature used in painting
the apple.</p>

<p>In teaching children color, we will use, if possible,
Dr. Montessori’s own box of sixty-four color
spools that include almost all the tints and shades
of the prismatic colors, black to gray, and the
scale of browns. If we are not so fortunate as to
be able to use this apparatus, which is a most
careful and scientific analysis of color, we can try
to study color ourselves, and point it out to children
as it is found in the home in textiles, silk
and worsted, papers, flowers, and colored crayons
and paints.</p>

<p>In teaching color at home we may all follow
Dr. Montessori’s own simple method. The Montessori
directress might have tried to teach Raffaelo
color as we, in America, teach our children,
saying:</p>

<p>“See the ball; it is red. The forget-me-not is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
blue. See the pretty robin redbreast,” and in
making these statements confusing in the child’s
mind the concepts of toy, flowers, birds, and colors
when all he needs is <em>color</em>. Every child wants to
make his own application of knowledge. Instead,
the girl who had been trained under Dr. Montessori
had followed the only true method of teaching
any fact, the method that lies at the basis
of Montessori education miracles. Dr. Montessori
says that teaching must be <em>simple</em> and <em>objective</em>.
There hasn’t been enough of “calling a spade a
<em>spade</em>” in our American schools and homes.</p>

<p>Show your child red, or the letter A, or a moral
fact—it doesn’t matter much which—and name it
<em>red</em>, or <em>A</em>, or <em>right</em>.</p>

<p>Ask him to tell <em>you</em> just what you told him
about it.</p>

<p>Ask him to pick out red from other colors, or
A from other letters, or a moral act from immoral
acts. This is Montessori teaching reduced
to A B C, but it is teaching that is successful.</p>

<p>Our homes may be made as full of color and
beauty for little children as are the Children’s
Houses. The use of the prism, the Montessori
color spools, the color top, our beautifully graded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
colored crayons and water colors for filling in
outlined pictures, a study of the colored papers to
be had for paper dolls’ clothes, the daily watching
of the color changes in sunrise and sunset—all
these open the spirit eyes of the child. Then we
will lead children to notice and appreciate harmonious
blending of tints and shades in our walls,
our rugs, our gardens, our picture galleries.</p>

<p>Of what value is it that the child’s chromatic
sense be trained by learning to know and discriminate
between red, blue, and yellow, and from
this to acquire a facility in knowing the scale of
grays and browns? It means more for the child
than just the soul-satisfaction that comes from
learning how to use the eyes. It means <em>starting</em>
the brain machine and then looking out for the
switch.</p>

<p>The first morning that I met little Mario, one
of my child Montessori friends in Rome, he looked
me over from head to foot, ran to a color box,
selected a color spool of the exact shade of gray
blue of my suit and showed it to me joyfully. In
almost the same second that he made this mental
decision, he saw that the quick movements of little
Valia were threatening the safety of a glass vase<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
that stood, holding flowers, on a table at the opposite
end of the room. Like a flash, Mario ran,
held the vase, and prevented the catastrophe.</p>

<p>To be able to think down the color scale from
blue to a blue that is mixed with gray; to be able
to think in another kind of mental scale from
cause to effect—these are both <em>chromatic</em> mind
operations.</p>

<p>To know color means satisfying your child’s
beauty hunger. It means, also, starting him on
the road to logical thinking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="THE_GOING_AWAY_OF_ANTONIO">THE GOING AWAY OF ANTONIO<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Directing the Child Will</i></span></h2>

<p>Antonio had a longing to <em>do</em>.</p>

<p>Since babyhood, he had watched the <i lang="it">madre</i>
<em>doing</em> about the house, the <i lang="it">padre</i> who left each
morning and returned each night after a day of
<em>doing</em> somewhere.</p>

<p>All of Antonio’s most interesting world of little
things revolved about a circle of persistent activity.
The earth in the garden moved with its life
of roots and bulbs, the very small ant creatures
crept about from sunrise to sunset with their sand
burdens, the gray branches of the olive opened to
show their hidden treasures of leaves; the birds
built; Luigi, the old farmer beyond the garden,
continually loaded and unloaded his creaking
yellow cart. Antonio absorbed this life
energy with as much hunger as he ate his soup
and figs.</p>

<p>“I will, also, <em>do</em> all day,” he decided, ready to
try the adventure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>“I will make a little garden,” he chose one
morning.</p>

<p>The spade was too huge for baby fingers, the
frost-hardened ground demanded force in digging.
Some hyacinth stalks, just pushing their odorous,
purple way up through the mold, were broken by
Antonio’s eager effort. Still, the little boy persisted,
endeavoring to accomplish the task that his
imagination pictured—a little round flower-bed of
his own, made by his hands, and in which flowers
of all colors might raise their heads overnight.
Now he smelled them; now he could feel their
velvet-soft petals.</p>

<p>“Stop! Come here, naughty Antonio. You
cannot make a garden; you are too small. And
you dirty your clean apron.”</p>

<p>Antonio dropped the spade as the words of
his <i lang="it">madre</i> shrilled through the air. He sat down
in a discouraged heap on the edge of the path.
Always, his <i lang="it">madre</i> could persist in tasks, but he
was continually interfered with. Why?</p>

<p>But with the buoyancy of childhood, the little
man suddenly jumped up. A rattle of tin bells
and a strident shriek of protesting, ungreased
wheels were the prelude to Luigi’s approach. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
his cart of oranges and lemons, with bunches of
poppy and wheat stuck in the chinks, Luigi rode
down the lane. His smiling face was as russet
and wrinkled as an old nut, bits of miracle-hiding
clod stuck to his blue smock. As he passed, he
tossed an orange to Antonio.</p>

<p>“I will be a farmer. How fine to earn money
for my family, as Luigi does,” little Antonio decided.
He ran to the house and, pulling out his
little cart, loaded it with some of the vegetables
that stood in baskets in the kitchen. He trundled
it up and down, calling his wares as he had heard
Luigi. At first his <i lang="it">madre</i> laughed. Then, watching
him, her smile furrowed itself into a frown.</p>

<p>“Why play that you are Luigi, who is only
a farmer?” she expostulated. “Be a great general.
Here are your toy soldiers.” She pulled
his little cart away from Antonio and pushed into
his arms a box of gaudy tin soldiers.</p>

<p>“Drill them; command them,” the <i lang="it">madre</i> urged
Antonio.</p>

<p>Antonio watched, sadly, the demolition of the
little cart which stood for playing into breadwinning.
His soldiers were painted manikins, not
very steady on their legs and only slightly interesting.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
He tried to stand them in rows and they
all tumbled down. He changed them for his ball,
and his <i lang="it">madre</i> suggested that a picture book would
be a better plaything for the house, taking the
ball away from him. When he was absorbed in
the book, she tore him from it for a walk with
her in the streets.</p>

<p>So it always happened with Antonio. No one
allowed him to <em>persist</em> in an occupation, no one
allowed him to <em>choose</em> what he should do, and each
day’s activities were <em>decided for him</em>.</p>

<p>From a strong-willed baby whose impulses were
all good, Antonio drifted into weak-willed little
boyhood. It was as if he were daily followed by
a spirit of indecision.</p>

<p>“Shall I concentrate on this play?” Antonio
would ask himself, and in reply the spirit which
had risen from his babyhood influences whispered
in his ear, “No.”</p>

<p>Then came his manhood, and he asked himself
the same question.</p>

<p>“Why persist? It is easier to shift, continually,
from one occupation to another, not doing
anything long, or well.</p>

<p>“Why trouble to choose? My mother made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
decisions for me when I was a little boy; the public
school teachers chose my studies for me; now that
I am a man, let other men think for me. I have
no power to control my will.”</p>

<p>How simple a solution of the life question! The
fingers of Antonio that had itched in babyhood
to make the earth bloom and to earn bread closed
quiescently about a dagger handed him by a man
who said, “Come with me; do as I decide for you.”
The crime Antonio did was not his fault, nor the
fault of his accomplice. It was the fault of his
<i lang="it">madre</i>.</p>

<p>Dr. Montessori tells the story of the child whose
will is misdirected in babyhood. He is the child
whom his mother and the public school system
mold into a lump of putty by thinking for him.</p>

<p>The greatest problem of to-day in child-training
is, how shall we help our little ones to strength
of will? Civilization is being sapped by our weaklings.
Home-training, the public schools do not
develop character. Dr. Montessori tells us that
this is because parents and teachers do not know
what will, fundamentally, is.</p>

<p>Dr. Montessori says, “To will is to be <em>able</em>.
The little child who persistently struggles to pile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
block upon block until a miniature tower or castle
rises under his fingers, <em>persisting until he completes</em>
the labor, is taking his first step toward
will-training.</p>

<p>“Family life, trade life are built up on this
persistency. Whether it shows itself in loving,
or giving or working, constancy makes the social
will. Every motor activity is an act of will, and
constancy in <em>right</em> activities makes character.”</p>

<p>Other great teachers have said the study of
mathematics and the dead languages, the military
discipline of the army, mortification of the flesh,
make character. To train a child’s will we feel we
must crucify it upon the cross of our desires. A
child must obey us, we say, follow our caprices and
chisel himself into a likeness to us, because we wish
him to be like us. Why should children be little
men and women? Are we so sure of our own perfection
that we have a right to force our personality
upon that of our children?</p>

<p>Dr. Montessori gives us a new rule for developing
character in children. She says:</p>

<p>“<em>Seek the child’s first longings</em> if you would
train his will. Give him the foundation of will by
helping him to concentrate on something he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
instinctively craves to be busy about and so lay the
foundation stones of his character.”</p>

<p>The little child’s first impulses to be active are
good. He wants to be about his father’s business
by taking part in the activities of the home. We
make our children weak-willed by our own capriciousness
in interfering with their attempts to
be active. We dress them, we feed them, we wait
on them, we drive them to play, we lead them;
we put them in kindergartens where they flit from
one occupation to another without an opportunity
to concentrate on one; we put them in schools
where their days are cut up into little bundles of
study, tied with the iron chains of Schedule that
make prisoners of children; we continually decide
for our little ones and kill their characters with
the sword of misdirected kindness.</p>

<p>Some children are born with the color of painters
in their souls, and we punish them for soiling
<em>our</em> pictures and mussing <em>our</em> tapestries and
trampling upon <em>our</em> gardens. May we not look
beyond their impotent acts to the spirit-longing
that prompted them and put into their hands the
best in the way of color: paints, crayons, books,
flowers that will satisfy their desires and give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
them an opportunity to concentrate on the activity
they instinctively crave. So they gain will
power.</p>

<p>Other children are born with a vision of the
builder in their eyes, and we thwart them when
they try to use the furnishings of the home in a
process of reconstruction. May we not equip our
little architects with materials for building, call
their attention to the classic in architecture and
art, give them a chance to build their own characters?</p>

<p>Most children are born little cosmopolites—small
world citizens who explore with the greatest
interest the strange, new environment in which
they find themselves. These are the children whom
our present system of coercion in home and school
hurts most. We crush their wills by not giving
them an opportunity to follow their instinctive
interests in babyhood. The innate impulses of such
children are good. They must explore and produce
around themselves. They must be helped
to wise choice and right decisions. So they grow
to willed man and womanhood.</p>

<p>Is this following of personal impulse, as shown
in Montessori-trained children, productive of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
better concentration than we find in our public
schools to-day?</p>

<p>Part of the Montessori didactic material for
teaching numbers consists of a cardboard case into
which cards bearing big black figures may be
slipped, giving the child an opportunity to work
out number combinations. A little lad of five
discovered one morning, when I was observing at
the Via Giusti Montessori school in Rome, that
he could slip into his case cards in regular succession
that would count to one hundred by fives.
He spread out his cards upon the sunny floor,
provided himself with the polished counting sticks
for verifying each operation; then kneeling in
front of his counting frame, he went to work,
alone, concentrated.</p>

<p>It was visiting day at the School. Tourists,
teachers, students lined the room to the number
of forty or fifty, leaving the children scant space
to work, and as the little boy’s numerical adventure
began, they crowded closer to watch him.
An American public school child would have grown
restive and self-conscious, but this little Montessori
lad might have been alone in the Sahara,
so quiet, so unheeding of anything but his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
occupation was he. The number cards are large,
and it took a good many to reach one hundred.
The little fellow spread them out in the center
of the floor, then carried the row under the chairs
of the visitors, not seeming to notice the presence
of the grown-ups.</p>

<p>The morning grew gold with noon, and the other
children, quietly putting away their materials,
spread the low tables for the midday meal. Little
white bowls, snowy napkins, carefully laid spoons—then
the steaming chicken broth. Still the little
counter did not move. He had reached seventy-five,
after verifying every number he had registered
in the case. One of the wee waitresses for
the day carried his red and green luncheon basket
and set it down on the floor in front of him;
he did not heed it.</p>

<p>“Why doesn’t somebody stop that child’s counting
and <em>make</em> him eat his lunch,” expostulated
a nervous American school teacher, watching.
“Children should be made to do certain things at
certain times,” she explained.</p>

<p>Just then the boy slowly and with great pains
fitted a figure one and two ciphers into the counting
case. Like a little conqueror he stood up,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
folded his arms, and looked at the perfect result
of two hours’ willed, concentrated work. A smile
broke the baby face into dimples, and running
out into the garden, he began to play like a little
colt. He was not tired. He was not hungry.
He was only joyful at this conquest of his will.</p>

<p>Montessori will-training proves itself in results.</p>

<p>The practical life and gymnastic exercises of
the method have a peculiar value in relation to
the strengthening of the child will. Once a child
has learned to inhibit his scattering muscular disorder
in such co-ordinations as are involved in
dressing and undressing, feeding himself, bathing,
taking part in the everyday work of the home as
far as possible; in walking, running, marching,
skipping, dancing to music, and the other rhythmic
and gymnastic exercises involved in the Montessori
system, he has fixed a permanent habit of muscular
control which establishes, also, mental control.
To be able to place dishes and silver in an
orderly way on a table, to carry and balance a
tray containing several filled cups or glasses, to
be responsible for a certain drawer or cupboard
shelf or case in which are contained play materials
is to be able to control mind as well as body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>The muscular education of Montessori that has
a direct bearing upon the direction and development
of the child’s will is included in the primary
activities of everyday life, in walking, greeting,
rising, and handling objects gracefully; in the
proper care of the person, in taking part in the
management of the household, in gardening, in
such handwork as clay modeling and drawing and
in all properly co-ordinated gymnastic and rhythmic
movements. This new and direct will-training
is possible in any home.</p>

<p>A more subtle but quite as important phase of
control of the will through <em>doing</em> is seen in connection
with the child’s use of the didactic apparatus,
especially the solid and geometric insets,
the tower, and the broad and long stair. In the
use of each of these there lies for the child a very
important quality of self-correction. A broad
cylinder will not fit into a narrow hole; the plain
rectangular inset cannot be made to slip into the
outline of the board intended for a square; a misplaced
block or rod spoils the sequence of form
and number in the tower or the stairs. After
being shown the perfect way of carrying on each
of these exercises, the child experiments with them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
alone. He discovers that the material admits of
two possibilities: error and success. The success
possibility is the greater, however; it is easier to
drop a solid inset into an opening that fits than
to endeavor to crush it into a hole that is too
small. So, by persistent and repeated experiment,
the child attains a habit of correcting his
own mistakes. This habit he carries over into the
other willed activities of his life.</p>

<p>The Montessori method presents three steps in
the home development of the child’s will. First,
we must give our children as wide and free an
opportunity as possible to be active, especially
with their hands, along those lines which will lead
to muscular control. Second, we must not interfere
with a little child’s concentrated occupation
through play. Last, whatever task we set for him
to do, we must outline a right way in which it
should be accomplished and encourage him to correct
his own errors in it.</p>

<p>A mother said to me recently, “I keep the children
in bibs still, although I suppose they have
outgrown them. We can’t have our meals delayed
while we wait for three active youngsters to fold
napkins.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Montessori would have patiently and painstakingly
instituted the napkin habit, realizing that
in even so simple and homely an operation as folding
a square of linen neatly lie undreamed possibilities
of strengthening a child’s will.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>The Nature-Training of the Method</i></span></h2>

<p>“If you put it to sleep in the good brown
earth, Andrea, if you tend it and wait with patience,”
explained the Signorina, “you will see a
wonder.”</p>

<p>Andrea turned the brown lump over and over
in his hand. He rubbed it on the sleeve of his
apron. He held it up to the light. It had no
appearance of wonder; it was cold, it did not
shine, it would not reflect the light. Did the
Signorina, after all, <em>know</em>, Andrea wondered, as
his big, wistful eyes looked out from the warm
cheerfulness of the schoolroom to the chill, wind-swept
spaces of the Convent garden. Memories
of great banks of gold daisies, roses so heavy
with crimson petals that they bent as low as the
little green winding paths, winds sweet with perfume
of the grape filled Andrea’s imagination.
These had made the garden of the Children’s
House yesterday. But how different it was to-day!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Could the dead bulb which was his, now, to tend,
to watch, to believe in, make for itself life and
bloom?</p>

<p>Andrea, the matter-of-fact little man of four,
was skeptical.</p>

<p>“Of what use is it to plant?” he queried.</p>

<p>“Try it! I will help you dig a hole,” Bruno,
the helpful, volunteered.</p>

<p>“We will not let any child take it out of its
bed; we will protect it for you, Andrea,” assured
Piccola, flashing eyes full of the fire of anticipated
battle.</p>

<p>“Cover it carefully with earth, and only be patient,”
reiterated the Signorina. “Believe me. It
will make for you a surprise.”</p>

<p>It was a momentous morning that marked Andrea’s
planting. His fat fingers, holding the
trowel, trembled. Like a circle of small acolytes,
Bruno, Little Brother, Piccola, and the rest, white
aprons fluttering in the wind, watched the sacrifice.
Covered out of vision in its winter grave, the bulb
disappeared and the children, now almost as
skeptical as Andrea of its possible germ of life,
ran back to their work in the schoolroom. All,
save Andrea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>His baby hands, like two warm, brown leaves,
fluttered over the earth prison of his bulb. Kneeling
down on the frosty path, he bent low, listening,
as if he hoped that he might perhaps hear
the groping of new roots. It was all very cold,
and perfectly still about the place where he had
buried his little dead hope, but Andrea whispered
to it:</p>

<p>“I will wait,” he promised.</p>

<p>The bleak Roman winter spent its chill days.
Flurries of snow shrouded the garden and the
wide doors of the Convent, open so many days of
the year, were closed. Andrea did not forget his
bulb, though. Every day he ran out to the place
where he had buried it, eagerly watching for the
slim green fingers he had been told would push
their way through the frosty earth. As the weeks
drifted by, and while the garden was still bare, a
strange thing happened to the soul of little
Andrea. The patience that was necessary for
keeping alive his hope in the brown bulb began to
show itself in other ways.</p>

<p>“Andrea no longer frowns when the little
brother of Bruno takes away his letters,” the
Signorina exclaimed. “Instead, he goes to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
cabinet and fetches a buttoning frame, offering
it to the little one instead of the letters for which
he is not ready.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 330px;" id="illus14">
<img src="images/illus14.jpg" width="330" height="500" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Every child should have a pet.</p>
</div>

<p>In other ways Andrea proved his patience. A
bit of drawing that he had finished, hastily, a
month before and with crooked lines, now held
him concentrated for an hour, and was completed
with exquisite neatness and exact contour of line.
At the midday meal of the children Andrea did not,
as formerly, beg to be served first, nor did he
open his little green basket of luncheon before
the other children. It was as if the slow-growing
bulb which was working its sure way
up through the bare ground to the sun had
its counterpart in the unfolding root of patience
it had planted in the heart of a little
child.</p>

<p>After a little, the winter melted into a spring
of yellow lilies and long sunny noons and laughter
at all the gray street corners. Andrea came
earlier than the other little ones to the Children’s
House each morning, that he might spend a half
hour with his little green watering pot in the
garden. He met Bruno and Piccola with an air
of assurance that set him apart from them. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
held his head very high in those days because of
realized hope which he had made his own.</p>

<p>“Andrea is our little gardener,” the children
said to each other, watching his triumph.</p>

<p>Then came a visitor’s morning at the Children’s
House of the Via Giusti Convent. The children’s
greatest happiness was to welcome these grown-up
friends who came to learn of the little ones the
truths of life. Among the throng of students,
tourists, curiosity seekers, earnest thinkers, a
woman whom the children knew entered and slipped
into a waiting chair. She had been during the
winter a frequent visitor, quiet, sympathetic, with
deep, smiling eyes. Then she had not come to
the Children’s House for many days.</p>

<p>But they remembered her still. As flowers turn
to meet the sun, they twined about her, feeling
her soft, strong hands, touching with eager finger
tips the dull, clinging garment that draped
her. Ah, they drew back, consulting together in
little questioning groups.</p>

<p>“She wears now a black dress.”</p>

<p>“Her eyes are full of sorrow,” they said.</p>

<p>“The Signorina tells us that, now, she has no
<i lang="it">madre</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>Andrea, apart from the others, listened, sympathetic,
wondering. Sorrow should be replaced
by happiness, of this he was quite sure. Was
not the most unhappy child in the Children’s
House the one most loved, most helped by his
Signorina? Had he anything to offer this friend
that would give her joy? He ran to her, grasped
her hand in his; dragged her from her chair, across
the threshold, into a luring little green path dented
with many child footprints.</p>

<p>“See!” he exclaimed. “I waited.”</p>

<p>Where Andrea had laid away his hope, a tall,
straight stalk of heavily odorous lily bloom
pointed skyward. The earth that it had scattered
in its bulb-bursting still surrounded the
strong, green stalk. It was a chalice of the spring,
a symbol of life that is eternal.</p>

<p>“I planted it and I waited,” Andrea repeated.
“All the children waited with me.</p>

<p>“It blooms,” he finished, laughing up into the
joyful eyes that smiled back, comforted, into his.</p>

<p>Life is a phenomenon in which no force is wasted
and out of whose apparent death there continually
confronts us the wonder of new life. Some of us
are blind to the lessons Nature teaches, but little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
children may be led to <em>feel</em> nature facts that spell
for them faith and hope and sympathy for all
time.</p>

<p>Dr. Montessori tells us the place of nature in
education. We will put the planting and tending
of little gardens, which are the child’s own, above
the place which such work has held, formerly, as
a part of manual education. We will make gardening
a means of leading our little ones to <em>observe</em>
the phenomena of life, to be <em>patient</em> in waiting
for that life to manifest itself, and to be very
sure in the hope that fruition will come.</p>

<p>Does <em>your</em> little Andrea, your child who has
come to you with such a divine curiosity about
life and so quick a sense to feel it, have a chance
to be, himself, a part of the miracle by helping
something to grow? To plant a seed, to surround
it with all the best conditions for growth, to
tend it, to wait for its flowerings—this is Montessori
development possible for any child.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;" id="illus15">
<img src="images/illus15.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="" />
<p class="caption">The loving care of a dumb animal results in child sympathy.</p>
</div>

<p>Many of us feel that we are bringing our little
ones into a nearness with nature when we show
them beautiful pictures of flowers, lead them to
exquisite gardens in which they must not pick the
flowers, or take them to walk in our parks. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
is not making nature a force in the life of a child
as Dr. Montessori would have us. Children must
<em>touch</em> and <em>feel</em> and <em>act</em> to know. The flower that
is too beautiful for little fingers to gracefully pick
and give to a friend as an offering of love should
have no place in our gardens. The grass that is
too soft to bear the prints of little feet is not
the right kind of grass for an American park.</p>

<p>To plant a bean in a clay pot that stands on
a city window sill; to tend the plant that grows
from the seed, saying with surety, “Some day
there will be beans on this plant,” means more to
a child than to be told the life story of an orchid.
It is the difference between <em>thinking</em> and <em>feeling.</em></p>

<p>A rake, a shovel, a little basket, a cart, a watering
pot—these are all Montessori didactic materials
that any child in any home may have. A
flower pot in a window, a window box, a tiny plot
of earth in which to plant, one of these is possible
for each of our children, and the flowers and fruits
that result from the nurture of child hands mean,
for the child, flowers and fruits of the spirit.</p>

<p>The world of every day is full of gardens for
our children to plant, and helpless, dumb animals
to be fed and cared for by child hands. It has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
been so easy for us to do these things ourselves
that we have not stopped to think what it means
in the life of a child to have <em>helped something to
live</em>.</p>

<p>There is the bare seed, without shape or body
or hint of promise. There is the green, groping
plant that appears. Then comes the sure blooming
that rewards child patience. Some plants are
more slow to sprout than others; there is the
fruit tree that did not sprout in the child’s life but
whose pink blooms he now sees. So it may be
that the good hope planted in his own heart while
he is still a little fellow may not fructify for a
long time, but he will wait, with patience and faith.</p>

<p>Caring for plants and dumb animals has further
life application for children. We continually
serve our little ones. Because we love them, we
do too much for children; we take from their eager
hands all works of service for others which would
do much to develop the latent sympathy that
buds in every child’s heart, only waiting for the
slightest stimulus which will make it expand and
develop.</p>

<p class="caption">To feel that something is dependent upon him for care
and food helps a child to reverence life.</p>
</div>

<p>Your child needs one plant that is dependent
for life upon his care. He needs one pet that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
demands his daily forethought and vigilance to
safeguard its life. As he waters the plant, watching
it and providing for it the best conditions
of light and freedom; as he feeds his pet, your
child feels and is able to image the watchfulness
of his father and mother who feed and care for
him, who gave <em>him</em> life. He will form a habit of
<em>feeling</em> and <em>helping</em>, and will grow up loving, sympathetic,
and with a reverence for the phenomena
of life.</p>

<p>There are also the rewards that nature gives
children, coming as marvelous surprises, unexplainable
mysteries, beyond the work of hands.
The little ones at the Via Giusti Children’s House
in Rome may be often seen clustered about a blossom
that has unfolded while they were at home
and waits to greet them in the morning—so different,
so vastly more beautiful than the tiny seed
which they sowed. These children would not care
for a crude toy, given them as a reward for their
labors. The toy can be explained; it is made of
wood, or iron; it has no connection with the child’s
work for which it is given as a prize.</p>

<p>But here is a lily, the reward of their work,
but unexplainable; the product of a force that is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
miracle working. Its petals are like wax. With
their sensitized little fingers the children touch
them; no, they are not wax. No one can tell of
what texture these petals are made. The flower
has its own perfume, haunting, individual. Andrea
did not plant those petals, he did not smell that
perfume when he buried his hope. It found its
own body.</p>

<p>So with the greatest simplicity, Dr. Montessori
brings to children the truths learned from the
cultivation of <em>life</em>.</p>

<p>“I have something strange in my pocket,” Olga
exclaimed to the group of little ones who clustered
about her, twittering, poised in excitement
like a flock of baby birds.</p>

<p>It was just after the luncheon hour in the Children’s
House, and the babies filled the sunshiny
paths of the garden or loitered in happy groups
in the cool stone cloister of the Convent.</p>

<p>“My mother told me the story of Pinocchio,
the wooden marionette, who had so many adventures
with a cricket for his friend, and also a
fairy with blue hair. It is too wonderful a story
to have been born in the mind of my mother. She
<em>found</em> it. I have it now, with me!”</p>

<p>There was a breathless hush among the little
ones. Pairs of blue and hazel eyes fixed every
motion of the little brown maid in the bright<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
pink apron. With slow dignity and an effect of
great mystery Olga thrust one chubby hand into
the depths of her pocket. The fingers fumbled
a bit, then pulled out a crumpled, printed page
torn from a book. Dropping, cross-legged, to the
stone floor of the cloister, Olga unfolded and
spread out the page in her lap. The others bent
over her with all the curiosity and reverence that
would be stimulated by a conjurer.</p>

<p>“Here is the mystery,” Olga announced, indicating
the printed words. “I have discovered that
<em>this</em> is the hiding place of Pinocchio. I have torn
it out of the book that I may carry it, always,
in my pocket.”</p>

<p>“Olga will carry Pinocchio in her pocket,” the
others exclaimed in hushed whispers, scattering
to talk over the matter. “Is it possible that we,
too, could find Pinocchio, as Olga has, and carry
him in <em>our</em> pockets?”</p>

<p>So it happened that the mothers of the children
of the Via Giusti School began to miss pages
from their newspapers, their magazines, their
books.</p>

<p>“We have very bad, destructive children,” they
decided, not stopping to question the reason for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
their little ones’ sudden interest in written language.</p>

<p>So it happened, also, that the directress of the
school, always alert to watch the mind phenomena
of her children, noticed that many children in the
school had torn bits of printed pages hidden in
their apron pockets, in the soles of their shoes,
in their caps. In the midst of their most fascinating
work, they would stop, take out these
scraps of print, smooth them, and trace the letters
with baby fingers.</p>

<p>“We have stories with us all the time; Pinocchio
is ours,” they said.</p>

<p>“My little discoverers!” the far-seeing directress
exclaimed. “They are not wilfully destructive.
They are ready, now, to create a new language
that will carry them farther than spoken
words can. Their longings shall be satisfied.”</p>

<p>One morning the directress gave Olga new materials
with which to work. There was a big,
white wood box divided into twenty-six compartments,
and in each compartment there was a huge
letter of the alphabet cut from pink or blue cardboard.
The blue letters were consonants; the
pink letters were vowels. Seated on a soft green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
rug on the floor, Olga spent hours taking the
letters out of their places, piling them in a colored
heap of many fascinating curves and angles, then
sorting them and putting each back in a compartment
in the box.</p>

<p>Sometimes, as Olga worked, the slim girl directress
dropped down on the rug beside her.
Picking up one of the cardboard letters, she would
say:</p>

<p>“This is A, Olga.”</p>

<p>“This is A,” Olga would repeat.</p>

<p>“Can you show me another A?” the directress
would then ask. And Olga would, readily, pick
out a similar letter.</p>

<p>“Where is A, Olga?” was the last question in
this teaching as Olga selected from the twenty-six
letters another A. So the little maid of four
years soon knew all the letters by name and sound.
And presently she was combining them to make
words and short sentences.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;" id="illus17">
<img src="images/illus17.jpg" width="400" height="500" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Building words with the movable alphabet.</p>
</div>

<p>As she laid together the letters that made up
each word, the words that combined to make sentences,
the directress analyzed each word for her,
phonetically. Soon, by hearing a word, distinctly
pronounced, Olga could select from her box of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
pink and blue symbols which represented sounds
to her now those letters which were necessary to
spell the word.</p>

<p>The directress presented to her smooth
white cards, on which were mounted large black
letters cut from coarse black emery cloth, as
rough as sandpaper. These letter cards Olga held
in one hand, tracing the outline of the letters with
the fingers of her other hand and saturating her
senses with the <em>feeling</em> of the letter shapes. Soon,
she could name any letter, her eyes closed, by the
sense of touch.</p>

<p>At the same time that Olga was learning to <em>see</em>
and <em>feel</em> letters, she was being helped to the muscular
control involved in writing. Upon a sheet
of white paper she laid one of the Montessori
geometric insets, a square, and selecting a brightly
colored pencil, she drew the outline of the square
upon the paper. Then, with the slanting lines
used in writing, Olga filled in the outline of the
square. At first, the lines were crooked, extending
beyond the boundary lines of the square; but
as she repeated the exercise, filling in with color
other forms, outlined triangles, rectangles, circles,
leaves, flowers, trees, and figures of children and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
animals, her muscles strengthened and she could
control her pencil with the utmost precision.</p>

<p>Two months after her first interest in a printed
page had shown itself, through no training save
these sensory and muscle exercises, Olga made the
miracle of graphic art her own. She went to the
blackboard and wrote in clear, flowing script: “I
read, I write.”</p>

<p><em>Your</em> baby tears picture books and magazines;
he leaves great, unbeautiful scrawls upon wall
paper, woodwork, and sidewalk. He upsets the
ink and breaks the pens in his father’s study. He
wishes to handle all the books upon the library
shelves. We punish him for these acts because we
think them wanton. Dr. Montessori tells us that
these child activities indicate an instinctive interest
in the <em>symbols</em> of that new art, human speech,
which he is making his own in the first years of
his life. They tell us that we have made a mistake
in not giving children an opportunity to
teach themselves to read and write at the same
time that they are mastering spoken language.
The two interests present themselves simultaneously
in our little ones. Children who tear books
and scribble upon walls and interfere with the immaculate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
order of our home secretaries are not
little mischief makers. Like Olga, and the other
babies in the Children’s House, they are trying to
<em>make their own</em> the story that you read them.
Even the tools of writing for little children are
gilded with the same air of mystery that touches
the untranslatable black print.</p>

<p>The wonder teaching of Montessori, by means
of which, after two or three months of preliminary
exercises, little ones “explode” into reading and
writing, may begin at home. Any watchful mother
may lay the foundations for this educational
marvel.</p>

<p>Have you watched the process by means of
which the little Stranger who came to you from
the unknown masters the strange speech of the
home in which he found himself?</p>

<p>Are you helping or hindering him in his struggles
to make language his own?</p>

<p>The beginnings of speech in the baby consist
in repetition of syllabic sounds which he hears in
his home environment. His vocal cords and tongue
educate themselves through pronouncing articulate
sounds. First come the labials. Then the
little one combines consonants and sounds, saying:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
“Ma-Ma. Pa-Pa.” The mechanism by means of
which the sense of hearing combines with the vocal
cords in helping the two-year-old to speak makes
it possible for a child to learn several foreign
languages in the first five years of his life.</p>

<p>The child is making his own dictionary in babyhood
and at a phenomenal rate of speed.</p>

<p>Dr. Montessori says that we may help a child
to beautifully phonetic speech and a large vocabulary
if we will eliminate all baby talk from our
nurseries, and see that the little one hears only
good models of speech. Clear-cut, carefully pronounced
words, well-planned and euphonious sentences,
rhythmic poems and classic stories read to
our children, these will train the sense of hearing
and lead to a large vocabulary and beautiful pronunciation.
Suppose you were learning a foreign
language, wouldn’t it discourage you to have your
interpreter mispronounce, <em>baby talk</em> French or
German or Italian to you? Our babies find themselves
in a land more strange to them than any
foreign country we have ever visited. We are their
interpreters; let us not put stumbling blocks in
their road to language.</p>

<p class="caption">Filling in outlines with color to gain

</div>

<p>Then, sometimes at three years, four, or five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
comes the tearing and scribbling stage. Every
mother knows it, but Dr. Montessori helps us to
a new recognition of its meaning. It isn’t a development
of the old Adam in your child. It’s a
guide signal for every mother. It tells you that
the intricate human mechanism that makes up the
child spirit is ready to learn written language
naturally, without undue nerve strain, if only the
right stimulus be offered.</p>

<p>It is because we have waited until the instinctive
interest in spoken language grows dull and because
we have depended upon only one sense, the
sense of vision, that teaching a child to read and
write has not been the natural, quick process nature
means it to be.</p>

<p>If the nursery equipment includes the movable
alphabet and the sandpaper letters of the Montessori
didactic materials, your little one, instead
of tearing letters, may <em>feel</em> them, his sense of
touch carrying to his mind a telegraphic message
of letter form that is registered permanently on
his brain. After handling these large, stiff, pink
and blue letters for a month or two, after tracing
with his sensitized finger tips the rough black
letters mounted on the smooth white cards, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
are so indelible a part of his mental life that they
<em>must</em> burst forth into writing without previous
training. Don’t you remember how your baby by
fingering his raised letters on his alphabet-bordered
bread-and-milk bowl, by feeling of the raised letters
on his alphabet blocks, by building words
with the cut-out wooden letters of his letter game,
learned without effort on your part how to print?
So, by touching the beautiful script letters of
Montessori, a child teaches himself to write.</p>

<p>But there is another process involved in the
Montessori method of helping very little children
to an early mastery of reading and writing. In
the public schools a pencil is put into the child’s
untrained fingers and we expect him to use it in
writing with no preliminary help in handling it.
We couldn’t use a needle in fine embroidery if we
had not learned, first, how to thread it. We are
not able to paint a picture of a landscape until
we learn how to use a brush in outlining perspective.
So we make a mistake when we expect that
to hold a pencil means to be able to write. We
must help children to the muscular control of this
tool of writing first. Dr. Montessori tells us that
drawing precedes writing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>The Montessori didactic materials for developing
in children the muscular control necessary for
writing include small wooden tables; flat metal
forms cut in various shapes, squares, rectangles,
circles, and triangles; plenty of white drawing
paper, and good colored pencils of the standard
colors and brown and black. Laying a form on a
piece of paper, the children draw its outline.
Removing the form, they <em>fill in</em> the outline, using
long, vertical, parallel lines of any color they like,
keeping within the contour of the outline. So
the child educates his muscles for writing without
<em>actually writing</em>.</p>

<p>The little ones at Rome soon experiment with
combining these forms to make colored borders
and flat designs, which they fill in with their colored
pencils in very harmonious color combinations.
Later, they fill in outlined pictures, using
the same free, regular pencil strokes.</p>

<p>The Montessori method of starting reading and
writing saves time in most instances. Whether or
not, however, it is at four years or five years or
five and one-half that the “explosion” into written
expression of thought occurs, the process by means
of which it is brought about is sure to give the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
child a firm perceptive basis for reading and
writing.</p>

<p>Our ordinary method of teaching reading and
writing is a utilization of the sense of sight, alone.
In some instances the children in the primary
grades of our schools begin writing by a system
of tracing letters and words offered them in large
script. This is purely a muscular process and
rarely absolutely successful, because it involves
fine muscular co-ordination for which the child of
five or even six years is not ready.</p>

<p>The Montessori sandpaper letters and movable
alphabet offer the child a chance to utilize his
sense of touch in learning the symbols of thought.
Formerly we showed him a word or a letter as
a means for gaining so vivid a mental image of
that letter that he would be able to recognize it
and write it. The method of Montessori sends a
telegraphic message by two wires to the child
mind, a visual and a tactile impression. The
tactile message is peculiarly valuable in strengthening
the mental image of the word or letter because
of the fact that the child is in a strong
sensory motor stage of his mental development.
To <em>touch</em> gives him stronger mental images than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
to <em>see</em>. To <em>feel</em> gives him, also, an impulse to imitate
and to express. This is why, after touching
and naming and differentiating and recognizing
blindfold and building words and sentences with
letters, the Montessori child spontaneously writes.</p>

<p>Because we are so anxious for immediate educational
results with our little ones, the spontaneous
reading and writing of the Montessori method has
seemed to parents one of its most important developments.
If, in our home Montessori experiments,
children do not read and write very early,
we are disappointed. We wonder if the system
has the value we attached to it. We must change
this state of mind.</p>

<p>There is the toddler of three who evinces an
instinctive longing to read and write. He experiments
with pencil and paper; he shows an interest
in the home books, newspapers, and periodicals;
he asks what the signs in the street cars and on
the billboards say. There is also the child, no less
promising, but more interested in objects than in
symbols, who does not show these manifestations
until the age of five and five and a half years.</p>

<p>We must recognize these signs according to the
child’s age and take advantage of them. The part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
of the mother is to watch for the dawning of the
interest in reading and writing and to give the
child an opportunity to perfect the physical and
mental mechanism for it.</p>

<p>Our homes and the educational helps to be
bought for children now furnish accessory material
for the Montessori process of teaching the
graphic art.</p>

<p>The first tracing of the sandpaper letters should
be preceded by exercises whose object will be the
refining of the tactile sense; dipping the fingers
into cold, hot, cool, and lukewarm water; differentiating
blindfolded rough, smooth, hard, soft
substances; recognizing with the finger tips alone
many different materials, paper, iron, wood, velvet,
cotton, silk, linen, satin, lace, needlework, and possible
combinations of these textiles. These exercises
form a most fascinating game for the child,
and, through them, he brings to the exercise of
tracing the sandpaper letters an exquisitely sensitized
touch which results in a clear impression of
their form.</p>

<p>As the child uses the movable alphabet upon
his play table or builds words and sentences upon
a bright rug spread out on the nursery floor, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
the activities of the home in which he has a part
and all his play life may be used as the basis of
his first reading. His favorite toys may be placed
about him as he constructs their names and little
word stories about them. Large colored pictures
of simple design may be laid on the floor as the
child combines letters to spell the objects contained
in them. The mother may write in large
script simple instructions which the child may
read and follow:</p>

<p>“Run to me.”</p>

<p>“Bring me your ball.”</p>

<p>“Close the door.”</p>

<p>Innumerable helps are to be procured for the
drawing by means of which Montessori establishes
the muscular control preliminary to writing. Our
art stores and kindergarten supply shops offer
beautifully colored crayons and drawing paper
at nominal cost. Blocks, the tin utensils of the
kitchen, and box covers offer geometric surfaces
about which the child may draw, if the drawing
board and forms of Montessori are not included in
the home equipment. These outlines the child will
delight in filling with color, using the diagonal
strokes that form a direct preparation for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
the muscular control involved in writing. Following
this coloring of geometric forms is the filling
in, similarly, of simple outlined pictures. We find
such outlined pictures in large variety in the school
and kindergarten supply shops. The toy dealers
supply books of really beautiful designs and pictures
for coloring. It is also possible to procure
sets of cardboard figures, animals, paper dolls, and
soldiers which the home child may draw around and
color.</p>

<p>One day, after having made his own, through
the sense of touch, the form of letters, and after
having learned muscular control in <em>drawing form</em>,
your child will write. How can he help it? You
will have established artificial conditions, muscle
and sense, similar to the conditions through which
he learns to talk.</p>

<p>The baby <em>hears</em> speech, and because heredity
perfected his vocal cords for reacting upon mental
stimulus of the sound—he <em>talks</em>. In the Montessori
method, he <em>feels</em> letters, and through the
perfecting of the muscles involved in reproducing
those letters which he has made his own by feeling—he
writes.</p>

<h2 id="CLARA-LITTLE_MOTHER">CLARA—LITTLE MOTHER<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>The Social Development of the Montessori Child</i></span></h2>

<p>Clara always saw me before I caught the outline
of her cherubic chubby person. She had constituted
herself the little four-year-old hostess of
the Trionfale Children’s House. Her limpid
brown eyes shone with welcome to a friend or
stranger. Her lips were overflowing with sweetly
liquid words of greeting. Her fat arms reached
out, her fat legs were winged with her friendliness.</p>

<p>She was the motherly, hen type of child, never
so full of joy as when she was greeting someone
or organizing a game or taking care of a child
younger than herself. An intensely feminine little
person was Clara, who would grow up into a
kindly, gracious woman, forceful in her own tactful,
woman way if she were surrounded by the
right influences in childhood or——</p>

<p>I very curiously watched the social development
of the chubby little girl in the bright pink frock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>Little Roman babies have the most fascinating
play fancies, I believe, of any in the world. Given
a cart and a faded flower or so, and Otello was
transformed in a second’s space into a busy
flower vender calling his posies up and down the
school yard, offering imaginary bunches and twining
imaginary wreaths. A pile of stones left
by the architects in a corner of the playground;
Mario was suddenly fired with the building zeal
of his Roman ancestors. Gathering a group of
boys to help him carry and lift the stones, he
would construct small models of the immortal walls
of the Cæsars and a possible arch of Titus.</p>

<p>Clara played, too, but not so much with <em>things</em>,
as with <em>groups</em>. Her play had the social quality
so important in the all-round development of the
individual.</p>

<p>She would gather together a group of little ones
for a festival procession or a folk dance, apportioning
strong partners for the weaker ones and
older ones for the babies. She played house daily,
but in a different, lavish kind of way. She had,
always, eight or ten make-believe children; found
room in her house of sticks and stones for the
fruit seller, the cheese man, the porter, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
stray musician or two. Her strongest instinct
seemed to be a collective one. She wanted to brood.
She wanted to be, also, a leader.</p>

<p>The Montessori directress let Clara very much
alone, smiling upon and encouraging her play,
but not trying to mold her instincts. If Clara
industriously swept out her domicile with a stick,
the directress did not run to her, offering her a
toy broom. When Clara was a little slow about
going into the schoolroom when the out-of-door
period was ended, the directress did not fret at
the little maid. She realized that Clara had
merged her own personality in the personalities of
the group of children with whom she had been
playing. She had been so busy preparing her
imaginary family for going to school that she did
not heed the call herself.</p>

<p>How would the social instinct so prominent in
Clara and in several other of the children find vent
inside the four walls of the Children’s House, I
wondered? Would the Montessori system, which
has for its basic principle auto-education, this system
of perfecting the individual through self-direction,
give Clara and the others a chance to develop
group activities?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>For some time the cool, white schoolroom was
the scene of individual work and personal endeavor.
Otello worked alone with the solid insets;
Mario’s fascinated fingers sorted colors. Clara
sat on the floor in the sunshine and constructed the
tower, but her keen eyes followed almost every
movement of the other children. Then, for the
school was in its inception and the children were
new, came a transition period, when the peace was
broken by perfectly normal, healthy brawls.
Someone overturned Otello’s cylinders and Otello
kicked the offender. Several children wanted the
same box of color spools at the same time. The
directress kindly interfered and gave the colors
to Clara, who had been first upon the scene. Clara
motioned the crowd to follow her. Now had come
her chance. She organized her group. She selected
a red spool and spread out upon a white
table its beautiful gradations from deepest crimson
to palest rose pink. Then she offered the
blue spools to Mario, showing him how to grade
the varying shades. It was fascinating, Mario
thought, to have Clara for his little teacher. He
motioned to several of the other children to join
them. Tables were drawn up; brown and golden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
heads bent close together as the little ones dabbled
in the colors, advising, helping, learning from
each other.</p>

<p>The directress hovered outside of the group,
suggesting but not forcing herself upon the children.
They turned to her when they needed her,
but their greatest interest lay in the joy and power
of working and learning together.</p>

<p>As one watched the phenomenon of this natural
unfolding of the social instinct in the method,
there were daily examples of its spontaneity. The
children, from a collection of units, had been transformed
into a small community in which there were
groups of workers, some large, some small, but
all co-operative. The children carried on the sense
exercises and took bold adventures into the fields
of reading and writing together. The Montessori
directress was always their captain and guide, but
the grouping and working with some other child
or children was the result of childish initiative.</p>

<p>It developed in this way.</p>

<p>The children learned to <em>live</em> together. They
found that the integrity of Clara’s group, of
Mario’s, or Otello’s, was preserved only if the individuals
in it gave themselves up to the good of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
the whole. It was pleasanter to move tables and
chairs softly, to wait one’s turn, and to avoid
jostling one’s neighbor. So kindness and neighborliness
and gentleness were learned by the children
through their own endeavor.</p>

<p>The children <em>learned</em> together. There were
groups of various grades of age and mental ability.
Here the children of three and four emptied
out an entire box of color spools and, each choosing a color,
helped each other grade. There, a
trio of energetic babies slopped in their basins,
endeavoring to wash each other to a common cleanliness.
In a quiet corner an older child taught
less advanced children to spell with the movable
alphabet or to work out arithmetic calculations
with the rods. This group learning was carefully
watched and safeguarded by the directress, but
she never forced her personality upon the children.
The children, left to their own efforts,
found a stimulus to a wholesome kind of competition.
They tried to outstrip each other in learning,
and put forth more effort than if they had
been urged by the teacher.</p>

<p>And, best of all, the children were <em>good</em> together.</p>

<p>If one child did anything that interfered with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
the rights of the others he was kindly but effectually
isolated. He was denied nothing save his
privilege of being an active, happy member of the
child republic. To be allowed to go back to it was
his ultimate joy.</p>

<p>The Montessori House of the Children is a place
of more unusual development of group activities
among little children than we have realized. There
is a larger opportunity for making children into
little citizens than in almost any other scheme of
education.</p>

<p>We have thought that the present practice of
the kindergarten, in which group activities are
organized and directed by the kindergartner, gives
little children the opportunity for the development
of the social instinct which they so much
need. At a signal, they rise and carry chairs,
or march in step, or play a game, but the signal
was given by the teacher. She directs the game.
We have wandered so far from the leading of the
gentle Froebel whose guiding star was the natural
impulses of individual children in his garden of
little ones.</p>

<p>It is vastly more difficult to lead a number of
children safely through a first transition period,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
when all their self-activity turns into channels of
disorder, than to check that disorder by force of
adult will. This is the task Dr. Montessori sets
for us, however, and she shows us, as the result
of our patient leading of the children into habits
of self-directed order, her peaceful, industrious
Houses of the Children. Like a hive of bees, the
little ones swarm in the flowering of their interests.
They are intent upon community welfare.</p>

<p>The problem of helping a child to be a perfect
social unit is as pressing a problem for the home
as for the school. We are following the letter
and not the spirit of Montessori when we offer
a home child the intellectual stimulus of her didactic
apparatus and deny him companionship in
the use of it. It is eye-opening for a child to so
learn form that he can detect slight variation of
outline and is able to perceive the beautiful combination
of lines which make a cathedral or an
arch. It is soul-opening for this same child to
help another child to a perception of this beauty.</p>

<p>The three periods of the spontaneous developing
of the Montessori children into collective activity,
as I observed them, have an even more direct
bearing upon the home. Left alone, offered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
scientific apparatus for mental, moral, and physical
growth, the Montessori children make these
important social adjustments.</p>

<p>They learn to <em>live</em> together.</p>

<p>They <em>learn</em> together.</p>

<p>They are <em>good</em> together.</p>

<p>A great deal is involved in the development of
each of these adjustments. We must study the
method of Montessori by means of which success
in group activity is made spontaneous.</p>

<p>To say to a child, “You must be polite. You
mustn’t be rude. It is ugly to be clumsy. It
isn’t nice to be selfish,” was the part of the older
decalogue in child-training. To teach a child
by careful physical and rhythmic exercise and
through simple acts of home helpfulness, so that
he is naturally graceful and courteous, is the
Montessori way. To provide him with play or
educational materials which have greater possibilities
of interest if shared—blocks, games, handicraft
materials—accomplishes unselfishness. Such
community play as is found in imitating the activities
of the childhood of the race—digging,
cooking, collecting, all kinds of building, trade,
plays, weaving, gardening in groups, and camping—is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
valuable because it helps children to merge
their personalities in the interests and life of a
<em>group</em>. The center of these child activities is
child interest, not adult pressure.</p>

<p>Dr. Montessori makes it possible for little children
to learn together, not according to schedule,
but in line with child interest.</p>

<p>A mother wrote me at great length and anxiously
in regard to what seemed to her a little
son’s lack of adaptability to the home use of the
Montessori didactic apparatus. The boy had toys,
books, colored pencils, blocks; he was endowed
with a vital interest in the world about him and
an alert mind, but he refused to play alone. He
preferred playing in the street with a group of
other children, their only play material being pebbles,
sand, or bricks, to playing at home with his
own beautiful equipment.</p>

<p>“How can I persuade Harold to work alone
with the Montessori apparatus?” his mother
queried.</p>

<p>It was important for this child and for all
children not to work alone. Any child will make
greater educational strides if the stimulus of other
child minds helps his intellectual growth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>To set a group of children of different heredity,
different mental and emotional development, and
different interests the same task is not only futile
but dangerous. It is apt to mold their plastic
minds to one line of thinking, is bound to make
them slaves of authority instead of free personalities.
But to offer a group of children the tools
of knowledge as exemplified in the Montessori didactic
materials and give them the opportunity
to gather in selected, interested groups for competitive
research and for helping where help is
needed is the most fruitful kind of learning.</p>

<p>This may be brought about in any home where
a few children from three to four or five years
of age meet regularly under the same conditions
for intellectual development that exist in the Children’s
Houses. Older children may be formed into
a neighborhood home study club. Released from
the bondage of the iron curriculum, they may find
in this club an opportunity for original research
along those intellectual lines which interest them
most; nature, the practical application of mathematics
in measuring and constructing toys, further
study of history and literature through story-telling,
making and dressing dolls to illustrate historical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
characters, and the writing and dramatizing
of simple plays.</p>

<p>As a further development of the Montessori
group activities we see, in imagination, in every
community a municipal Children’s House. Here,
children of all classes, ages, and degrees of intellectual
growth might meet, freely selecting from
a large variety of materials for mental and constructive
development those which they most need.
Also, we see them selecting their own social plane,
finding help and inspiration in collective work with
other children. In this municipal Children’s House
we would find groups of child artisans, fashioning
boards and molding bricks to make the buildings
for a toy village. There would be little sculptors
and painters, and perhaps a child poet or dramatist.
We would see small <i lang="fr">modistes</i> and milliners
learning, through designing doll costumes, the
finger deftness and artistic sense which come from
combining beautiful colors and textiles. Such a
Children’s House would have its own kitchen,
where the children could study foodstuffs and
cook and serve simple meals. Music would be a
development of the group activities. This would
constitute a laboratory for the most fruitful kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
of child study on the part of physicians, psychologists,
teachers, and parents, because child
growth under these conditions would be quite spontaneous
and along natural interest lines.</p>

<p>The last phase of Montessori collective work is
seen as a kind of flowering. After children learn
how to live together, after they have worked out
intellectual problems together, they are suddenly
discovered as being very kindly disposed toward
each other. It is as if the ultimate development of
co-operation were the elimination of war.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to say to a group of Montessori
children, “Be good.” They could not be
otherwise than good.</p>

<h2 id="PICCOLA-LITTLE_HOME_MAKER">PICCOLA—LITTLE HOME MAKER<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>The Helpfulness of the Montessori Child</i></span></h2>

<p>The visitor to a Montessori school in Rome is
faced by an anomaly.</p>

<p>Piccola, the emotional, eager little Italian girl
of five years, who is more difficult to control at
home than even the average American child, is
seen to be a self-controlled, useful member of a
child republic. Piccola’s first work of the morning
is to find her own pink apron that hangs on
a peg on the wall, and button herself into it with
patient perseverance. If the younger children
have difficulty putting on their aprons, Piccola
will patiently help them. Her next activity is,
also, along lines of helpfulness. She looks about
the wide spaces of the big room, where low white
tables and chairs, growing ivy plants, and plain
gray wall make a beautiful color scheme, to determine
if there is anything she,—wee Piccola,—may
do to help this beauty. Ah, Piccola sees
a speck of dust in one corner of the white stone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
floor. Darting to the outer room, where the
children remove and hang their wraps and wash
their hands before school, Piccola seizes a red
broom that is just the right length for her chubby
arms to handle easily and a shining little tin dustpan.
Hastening back, she brushes up the dust.
Then she waters the ivy with a small green watering
pot, fetches a white basin and a little white
scrubbing brush, and slops gayly in an energetic
attempt to wash off the tables. Last, she takes
some of the soft green and gray rugs that the
children use for working on when they sit on the
floor, and beats them in the garden with much
energy.</p>

<p>The other children have come, now, and having
selected their materials from the white cupboards
that line the wall, are busily at work. Piccola,
too, is busy, piling pink blocks in orderly fashion,
one upon the other. Her active mind is busy,
though, along another line as well; she watches
the other little ones furtively to see if there is
anything which she can do to help them. Bruno
drops his color spools; Piccola runs to help him
gather them up in his apron. Little Brother tumbles
down in a trip from his table to the material<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
cupboard; Piccola helps him to balance himself
again on his fat legs, and, winding two tender
little brown arms about him, she steers him in
safety on his way.</p>

<p>The hour for the midday luncheon comes. Piccola
daintily helps to spread the white luncheon
cloths, to lay the spoons in regular order at each
child’s place, to sort and place the bright baskets
in which the children have brought their sandwiches
and fruit. Not until all the others are
served does Piccola slip into her own empty place
and partake of her own luncheon.</p>

<p>Piccola’s mother marvels at the change that has
been wrought in Piccola by a few months in the
Montessori House of the Children. She reports
her observations to the Montessori directress who
has Piccola’s education in charge.</p>

<p>“Piccola dusts the home now, without my bidding.</p>

<p>“She picks up her dolls and her toys when
she has finished playing with them.</p>

<p>“She helps me lay the table for the noon meal.</p>

<p>“How did you teach these things to my wayward
little Piccola, Signorina?”</p>

<p>It is the query of the American mother who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
finds her little one who has spent a day in a good
Montessori school more helpful in the home than
before.</p>

<p>She also asks herself:</p>

<p>“How may I teach helpfulness to my
child?”</p>

<p>Dr. Montessori has discovered for us the marvel
that to bring helpfulness to a very little child
is not so much a matter of teaching as of fostering.
She shows us the instinct to help which manifests
itself in the very little child which we must detect,
watch, and foster until we form a <em>habit</em> of
<em>usefulness</em> in children. After all, to be useful to
oneself and to others is the greatest value of education
for life. Dr. Montessori puts this education
for utility on a very high plane.</p>

<p>The mother who carefully observes and analyzes
all the acts of the child of two and a half or
three years of age will discover that the baby
has a great desire to be busy, continually, and
in imitation of his mother’s busy-ness about the
home. He handles with the greatest eagerness and
interest his shoes, his father’s neckties, his mother’s
brush and comb, the family silver, the kitchen
utensils, the door latches and knobs, the window<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
fastenings. He is more interested in the tools of
grown-up housekeeping than he is in his toys.
Why is this?</p>

<p>A baby of twenty months spent an entire morning
collecting all the shoes he could find in his
mother’s room and carrying them about from one
room to another. He climbed up in a chair and
pulled a button hook off a dressing table. His
mother substituted his dolls, his rubber toys, a
ball for these, but the baby refused them. Finally
his mother snatched away the huge boot of his
father’s, which he was lovingly tugging about
from room to room and slapped his hands because
he cried at giving it up. The little man
cried again, and struggled against the brutal
force of his mother, who held him tightly
in her lap and changed his shoes for going
out in the afternoon. Again his hands were
slapped.</p>

<p>The baby had not been in the least naughty.
He wanted to learn how to button his own shoes
and his mother couldn’t understand this longing
which he had to express in action, having no words
with which to explain himself.</p>

<p>Nearly all the instincts of babyhood are <em>right</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
instincts, leading to good conduct. The child’s
first longing is to be able to fit himself to his environment,
and this means that he must learn to
handle those objects and do those things which
he sees his family doing. The average American
child grows up rather helpless and useless when it
comes to making social adjustments, because we
continually interfere with his first attempts to be
useful. We do for him those acts of utility which
he should learn himself, very early, while he is
still interested in them.</p>

<p>It is undoubtedly less time-taking to put on a
small boy’s shoes, button and lace them for him,
button his under and outer clothes, to tie his necktie,
and put on his rubbers, than to slowly and
patiently teach him to dress himself. To bathe a
child and brush and comb his hair is simpler than
to allow the baby to splash in water and revel
in soapsuds, as he must in learning the intricate
movements necessary for keeping himself tidy.
We wish to preserve, also, the immaculate order
of our neat bathrooms.</p>

<p>We like to open and close doors for the toddler;
it is our privilege of service, we feel. We
prefer to lay the table ourselves, and keep our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
spotless kitchens free of child finger marks. What
about the baby, though, who finds his attempts
to make himself useful thwarted at every turn
until he forms the habit of being waited on? This
is a wrecking habit for childhood; it is, also, a
habit that leads to our present extravagantly high
cost of adult living. The little child who expects
to be continually waited on is going to grow up
into a man or woman who will expect to be waited
on through life. Service is what doubles the
grocer’s, the butcher’s, the landlord’s, the shopkeeper’s
bills.</p>

<p>The useful helpfulness of the Montessori-trained
child is easily explained.</p>

<p>The Montessori schoolroom is so planned that
there is nothing which a child can hurt and a good
deal that he can help by his first clumsy, baby
attempts to be useful to himself and to others with
his hands. The children are free to move about
as much as they like, changing the position of the
light little chairs and tables, opening and closing
the doors that lead into the garden, unrolling and
then rolling up again the rugs, putting away the
didactic materials in the cupboards after they are
through with them, washing the tables and blackboards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
caring for plants and animals, and carrying
on countless other activities that bring about
hand and eye training.</p>

<p>The children learn, also, all the intricate activities
involved in the care of their bodies. They
wash their faces and hands, brush their hair, clean
their finger nails, black their shoes, put on and
take off their aprons. The dressing frames that
are included in the Montessori didactic materials
include all the different fastenings of a child’s
clothing; buttoning on red flannel, buttoning on
leather, buttoning on drill with tapes, lacing on
cloth and on leather, fastening hooks and eyes and
snaps, and tying bow knots.</p>

<p>It is quite amazing to see the eagerness with
which the Montessori children attack these very
universal activities of everyday life. The skill
they obtain in them proves the truth of Dr. Montessori’s
words:</p>

<p>“We habitually <em>serve</em> children. This is not
only an act of servility toward them, but it is dangerous
because it tends to suffocate their useful,
spontaneous activity. We are inclined to believe
that children are like puppets, and we wash them
and feed them as if they were dolls. We do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
stop to think that the child who does not do,
does not know how to do.</p>

<p>“Our duty toward children is, in every case,
that of helping them to make a conquest of such
<em>useful</em> acts as nature intended man to perform
for himself. The mother who feeds her child without
making the slightest effort to teach him to hold
and use a spoon for himself is not a good mother.
She offends the fundamental, human dignity of
her son,—she treats him as if he were a doll. Instead,
he is a <em>man</em>, confided for a time by nature
to her care.”</p>

<p>There are certain phases of the Montessori
method which a mother cannot apply in her home
because she has not the preliminary training and
the necessary teaching skill. There is not a single
activity of the Montessori training for personal
and community usefulness of the individual as
carried out in the Montessori school that may not
be practiced in any home. The Montessori schoolroom
is a working duplicate of the best conditions
which should exist in every home where there is
a baby. It is significant that nations have
been aroused by the education miracles wrought
in the Roman Children’s Houses. What, pray,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
is the matter with the American children’s
houses?</p>

<p>The home is a big workshop for turning out
child cosmopolites, small world citizens who will
grow up into useful men and women. In the home
the child may learn how to care for his body, how
to care for pets, plants, and all the <em>things</em> that
combine to fill the tool box of everyday living.
Here the child may learn that consideration for
others which will help him to be kind, quiet, unselfish,
and polite. Here, also, he may take a
small part in the care of the big human family
in preparing food, laying the table, learning
household cleanliness and household order. The
child instinct to fetch and carry, which shows
itself very early in the life of the baby, may be
turned into channels of usefulness if the child is
taught to happily wait on himself and others.</p>

<p>Much emphasis has been laid upon the didactic
apparatus of Montessori which has for its aim the
development of the several intellectual processes.
Considering these appliances for direct stimulation
and perfection of mental activity only, the
casual student of Montessori says that the system
is barren, that it takes into account none of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
emotional activities of the child, that it eliminates
educational play from the life of the little one.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the play instincts of the
child are so carefully met by Dr. Montessori that
they blossom into usefulness. Dr. Montessori
knows more about the spontaneous play of the
child from two and a half years to six than we do.
She sees that his play instincts are all, at first,
a struggling to be like his elders, to do the same
utilitarian things that he sees them do, to imitate
on a child plane the work of his mother in the
home or his father in the industrial world. With
this understanding of the possibilities of child play
for developing into future usefulness, Dr. Montessori
supplies children with those tools of play
which turn child play into exercises of helpfulness.</p>

<p>In the Trionfale School at Rome the free play
of the children has been especially safeguarded.
The toddlers utilize their instinct to fetch and
carry objects by loading, trundling, and unloading
the specially built, stout little wheelbarrows provided
for them. Very soon this play blossoms into
the desire to fetch and carry with some more useful
object in view. The children begin to show great
skill in removing and replacing their materials<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
from the school cupboards and putting them back
in an orderly fashion. They attain perfect muscular
control in laying the tables for luncheon and
serving the food daintily. In one corner of a
sunlit room at Trionfale there is a fascinating
little <i lang="fr">salon</i>. Soft rugs of small size, diminutive
green wicker easy-chairs, sofa, and round tea
table, books of colored pictures and large dolls’
dishes make it possible for the children to “play
house” under ideal conditions. They learn
through their play a sweet kind of hospitality, and
the little school “drawing-room” of Montessori
stands for a necessary development of the social
instinct in children which is important.</p>

<p>Dr. Montessori suggests to us those playthings
and play activities which will lead our children into
the art of being helpful and, which is much more
vital, will start in them habits of wanting to be
helpful. Her scheme of play is possible of adapting
to almost any home, and it has for its basis
the instinctive longing of every child to be useful
through his play.</p>

<p>A playroom should be a place, as Dr. Montessori
expresses it, where the children may amuse
themselves with games, stories, possibly music, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
the furnishing should be done with as much taste
as in the sitting-room of the adult members of the
family. Small tables, a sofa, and armchairs of
child size, one or two casts, copies of masterpieces
of art, and vases or bowls in which the children
may arrange flowers should be included. There
should be many picture books, blocks, dolls, and,
if possible, a musical instrument of some kind in
the nursery. Dr. Montessori suggests a piano or
harp of small dimensions. An important playroom
accessory is a low cupboard, with drawers in
which the children may keep their completed drawings,
paper dolls, scrap pictures, and any precious
collection of outside material such as seeds, leaves,
twigs, or pebbles which they long to keep and use
in their play. Half of this cupboard should consist
of shelves for bowls, plates, napkins, doilies,
spoons, knives, forks, a tray and tumblers for the
children to use in preparing and serving their
luncheon or in entertaining their friends. Stout
pottery of quaint shapes and exquisite gay coloring
may be obtained now. It is much more attractive
to the child of three and four years than
inadequate, tiny sets of dolls’ dishes. At least the
necessary bowl, plate, pitcher, and mug for serving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
the nursery supper should be supplied and the toddler
taught to serve and feed himself at a very
early age.</p>

<p>The child should have a little broom and dustpan
and scrubbing brush. He should have a low,
painted washstand with a basin, soap, and nail-brush.
He should be taught how to turn on and
off a water tap, filling a small pitcher, pail, or
basin, and carrying it, full, without spilling. He
should have low hooks for hanging his clothing for
outdoor wear. Both small boys and girls should
have bright little aprons, not so much for purposes
of cleanliness, although this is important, as
to inspire them to the feeling that work is dignified
and needs to be set apart by a uniform of
service.</p>

<p>Dr. Montessori urges that those toys which
we buy be selected having in mind helping the
child to be an actor in a little drama of home life.
A plaything, she feels, should be a work thing,
capable of bringing a life activity down to the
primitive plane of the child’s thinking.</p>

<p>Our toy shops offer us now a very wide variety
of such educational toys from which to choose.
We may find large dolls, modeled from life, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
wearing clothes similar to children and requiring
the same muscular co-ordination in fastening and
unfastening. There is large furniture for these
dolls, built on good lines and teaching a little girl
to make a bed neatly and keep the doll’s bureau
drawers in order. There are good-sized washing
sets, including tubs, basket, lines, clothespins,
ironing board, and sad irons; we find very complete
dolls’ houses, sewing materials with dolls’
patterns and small sewing machines, kitchens
where the child can pretend to cook, complete sets
of cooking utensils, and lifelike toy animals.</p>

<p>These toys Dr. Montessori urges us to use, realizing
that the child’s deepest play impulse is to
dramatize in the theater of the home playroom
the everyday utilitarian occupations of the race.</p>

<h2 id="MARIOS_PLAYS">MARIO’S PLAYS<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Montessori and the Child’s Imagination</i></span></h2>

<p>Mario played a great deal, and I noticed, as I
watched him critically, that his play was of a
very strongly imaginative kind.</p>

<p>He was one of the youngest of the little ones
at the Trionfale Children’s House, and it had
taken him a rather longer time than it had the
other children to gain control of his impulsive
hands, his little truant feet, his vagrant-tending
mind. During this first period of his Montessori
schooling, when his attention was scattering and
he found difficulty in making muscular co-ordination
and differentiating form and color clearly, he
seemed also to have difficulty in amusing himself.
His play impulses at this time seemed to be very
primitive; he took pleasure in idling in some sunny
spot, kitten-like, or he arranged and rearranged
the pieces of wicker furniture which filled the <i lang="fr">salon</i>
corner of the schoolroom, or he found entertainment
in interfering with the work of the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
little ones. There seemed to be no element of
creativeness or originality in his play.</p>

<p>Presently, however, Mario began to show a
steady intellectual development in his work.
Through the physical exercises of Montessori,
through the rhythmic exercises carried on with
music and through exercises of usefulness in keeping
himself and the room neat and waiting upon
others, he learned an important lesson of muscular
co-ordination.</p>

<p>He learned to make his body respond to the
command of his brain.</p>

<p>Through the sense exercises in recognizing fine
differentiations of color and form and weight and
sound and texture, Mario found a clear mental
vision. A month before, the hill back of the
school had been a blur to his mental vision. Now
it was, for him, a clear percept made up of various
component parts. He saw it tall, broad, steep,
colored in varying tints of green and brown; its
outlines were broken for him by the sunshine, the
gardens, the red and yellow tiled houses; he could
almost smell the sweet perfume from its orchards
and vineyards.</p>

<p>The sense-training of the Montessori system had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
quickened and clarified the little boy’s perceptive
faculties.</p>

<p>Following side by side with Mario’s new mental
development came as marked a development in
his play. His play impulses were no longer scattering
but had objectivity. He was, in fancy, a
steam engine puffing along or the little father of a
group of other children.</p>

<p>As he swung himself over the parallel bars in
the school yard he felt that he was a famous
acrobat entertaining an applauding audience. In
a second he slipped into another path of fancy;
as he piled stones into a pyramid, he was a great
builder. More than this, Mario’s newly-found
play impulses carried him into a unique plane of
idealism. Crouched in a sunny corner of the
playground, he was a sleeping seed; slowly and
with spontaneous grace the little body rose, arms
upstretched, as Mario felt in dreams the growth
of root and branch and flower. No one had taught
four-year-old Mario the skill of making real these
fantasies. How had he taken his way alone into
the fertile fields of the imagination?</p>

<p>It has been suggested that the Montessori system
does not take into account the stimulating of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
the child’s imagination. Daily instances of very
original, undirected imaginative play on the part
of Montessori children show a subtle force at work
in the method which results in a spontaneous unfolding
of the imagination. The games and plays
which we teach our children in kindergarten and
primary school are carried on by the Montessori-trained
children without adult supervision. Leaving
their work, they run to the garden or playground,
imitating with great freedom and beauty
of imagination the activities of the gardener, the
baker, the artisan, the street vender, and the traveling
musician. They even impersonate in a more
idealistic way, playing, as did little Mario, that
they are birds and flowers.</p>

<p>This natural expression of imagination in very
young children is an important development of the
method, and a suggestive one.</p>

<p>We are all familiar with the timid, shrinking
little child in the center of a game circle who
doesn’t want to be a chickadee, but who is urged
by the teacher in charge of the circle. The child
persists in her disinclination; she is overawed by
so large a ring of spectators; it is possible that
she has never seen a chickadee. The teacher, also,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
persists. She goes to the child and tries to teach
her the motions of bird flight, but the child sees
only an adult running about and waving her arms
in an unusual way. She does not connect the
spectacle in any way with the free flight of a bird,
and when she does take courage and tries to follow
the directions of her teacher, the little one is not
giving expression to her own mental image, but is
endeavoring to imitate a rather ungainly adult.</p>

<p>Is this play of the imaginative type?</p>

<p>It would seem as if we have lost sight of the
real character of this elusive, subtle, unexplainable
fruition of the mental faculties, the imagination.
It is the unforeseen mind power which makes
poets and painters and sculptors and conquerors.
It is a mind vision which sees success beyond defeat,
worth hidden in rags, and good blossoming
out of evil. It makes us hear the piping of Pan
as the wind blows the reeds beside the river; it
promises us a pot of gold if we can build ourselves
a rainbow bridge across every cloud of despair;
it shows us the lineaments of God in the guise of
sorrow and poverty.</p>

<p>Imagination in the child finds varied expressions.
There are a great many instances where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
a child who is lonely and longs for companionship
sees and holds daily intercourse with an invisible
playmate whom he can describe with great accuracy
of detail. In the majority of cases this invisible
playmate in disposition, appearance, and tastes
is unlike any member of the family or any friend of
the child’s. Where did the child find this fancy?</p>

<p>A child has the power of a seer to develop the
unknown potentialities in apparently dead things.
This dry brown leaf, frost-killed of the sap of life,
is, in the child’s fancy, a gnome, jumping along
in the path in front of him to warn the birds of
the coming of winter. An acorn is a golden goblet
brimming with fairy nectar; a hollow tree is a
magic place in which to set up a domicile. No
one schooled the child in these tricks of thought.
How did he find them?</p>

<p>Dr. Montessori explains the growth of child
imagination.</p>

<p>The child is born with a certain defined mental
equipment. He has instincts, inherited memories
they might be called, and he struggles to feed
these instincts. He has capacities for acquiring
good or bad habits very early. He has a race-old
longing to gain knowledge by means of his senses.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
Our part in the education of the child is to study
his instinctive activities, giving them opportunities
for free expression where they are important
for the child’s best mental development. A child
likes to play in the dirt because his ancestors lived
in caves and tilled the soil; it is necessary for the
child’s best development that he play in sand and
model in clay and plant little gardens. A child
instinctively fights because his ancestors survived
only by warfare; this child instinct we must inhibit.</p>

<p>We must establish good habits in a child early.
We must help him, through various sense exercises,
to gain clear percepts of his environment.
We must try not to force our adult view-point
upon the child, but endeavor to establish in him
a habit of independent self-active thought.</p>

<p>Then, after we have strengthened the general
intellectual processes of the child mind, Dr. Montessori
points to us a miracle. Dovetailing instinct
and habit and perception, the child intellect
begins to build. Clear percepts become concepts;
mental images become ideals, imagination appears,
building from the clay of everyday-mind stuff a
golden castle of dreams.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>Imagination cannot be taught. It can scarcely
be defined. It can never be prescribed and trained.
It is that flowering of the mind processes by
means of which a bit of brown sod appears tinted
with light and color to the artist, full of potentialities
of growth to the gardener, smells of home
to the wanderer. If the three types of minds,
as children, had been told that a similar piece
of sod was a blanket for the sleeping seeds, one
questions if it would have been gilded for them in
adult life with this glow of individual fancy. On
the contrary, the painter has been trained to see
color, the gardener has experienced the cultivation
of life in the earth, the home lover’s hungry
senses grasped the memory of former sense stimuli.</p>

<p>Dr. Montessori tells us that the imagination
develops variously in different individuals. There
may be a child who will never be able to pierce the
veil of reality and find his way into the court of
fantasy. There will be also the child who develops
a seerlike quality of idealism. He moves
in a world of blissful unrealities; he sees angels’
wings in the clouds and angels’ eyes in the stars.
Our part in the education of little children is to
build the tower for a possible poising of the child’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
wings of fancy. Then we will wait hopefully for
the wonder flight.</p>

<p>The various parts of the didactic apparatus of
Montessori presented to a child in their proper
relation to his stage of mental growth have a
definite place in strengthening the mental processes
which lie at the basis of imagination.</p>

<p>We are so unaccustomed to offering any sort of
mind food to the child of two and a half or three
that we have allowed the little child to go mind
hungry. At this early stage of a child’s development
the right kind of mental training will lay a
foundation for the constructive and intellectual
processes of imagination and reasoning.</p>

<p>The child of two and three years of age is at
the sensory-motor stage of mind development. He
longs for experiences which he can turn into action;
his mind craves ideas which will express themselves
in useful muscular co-ordination and the
ability to adjust himself to his environment. To
put into a child’s hands the materials for this
sensory-motor education early is not to overtax
his mind; instead, it satisfies his very important
mind hunger.</p>

<p>The didactic materials of Montessori that supply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
this sensory-motor need of the very young
child and should be presented early include the
various dressing frames, the solid insets, the sound
boxes, the blocks of the tower, the broad stair
and the long stair, the latter without the use of
the sandpaper numerals. As soon as the little
one has made his own the muscular co-ordination
and ideas of form in relation to size involved in
this material and has begun to find the will power
to correct his own mistakes, other home activities
involving these mental faculties should be added
to the use of the Montessori apparatus. The
child may dress, undress, bathe himself, dress and
undress a doll, build with large blocks, sort various
objects of different shapes and sizes, as seeds, nuts,
spools, button molds; handle and learn the uses
of the furnishings and equipment of the home:
toilet utensils, brush, broom, duster, dustpan,
kitchen appliances, and the like; he should receive
simple ear-training in discriminating different bell
tones, high and low, loud and soft notes played
on the piano, and hear good models of speech, both
in diction and modulation.</p>

<p>At the age of three to four years, the sensory
element in the child’s mental life is even more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
prominent, but it is separated a little from motor
activities. If the child has had adequate training,
he has obtained a large degree of muscular control;
he can handle objects without breaking them,
he can run without falling down, he can minister to
his own bodily needs. Now his mind is hungry
for sense images. He wishes to study his environment
with the aim of securing a series of definite
mind pictures. Ideas are to be stored in the workshop
of the child mind for future use in building
the power of constructive imagination.</p>

<p>The Montessori didactic apparatus suited to
this ideo-sensory stage of the child’s development
includes the color spools, the geometric insets, the
baric sense tablets, the sandpaper boards, and the
textiles. The sense-training involved in the child’s
use of these should be applied in various ways: finding
and matching home and outdoor colors, noting
the size, shape, and form of various everyday objects,
block building with an idea of form, cutting
form to line with blunt-pointed scissors, clay-modeling,
and constructive sand-play.</p>

<p>The child from four years to five shows a dawning
of the constructive imagination. The spool
with which he played like a kitten in baby days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
has new potentialities in his eyes. Having learned
that it is wooden, round, and will roll, and having
made a mental comparison of it with the wheel of
his toy cart, which is also wooden, round, and
will roll, he calls the spool a wheel. This is a very
important break in the child’s mental life. It
demonstrates to us that the child now has ideas
in the abstract. Dr. Montessori meets this with
those of her didactic appliances, which will lead
a child by natural, easy steps from objective to
abstract thinking. She strengthens the sensory
life of the child and guides him toward a grasp
of the symbols of thought. Those parts of the
didactic apparatus which should be presented at
this point to the child are the long stair, with the
sandpaper letters, and the various arithmetic exercises
to be had with the rods; the counting boxes
and frame, the sandpaper letters, the movable
alphabet, and the drawing tablets.</p>

<p>Now, the child shows individualistic thinking.
The direct mental training of Montessori has built
a solid foundation for the growth and unfolding
of the imagination. Our place is to watch for
the special trend of his mind development and help
this as far as lies in our power.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>Does the child show special interest in the symbols
and combinations of number? We should
help him to play store, provide him with numerical
games, give him a chance to spend and account for
a weekly allowance, do home errands, use a tool
box, construct cardboard toys, and learn any other
possible application of number in its relation to
life. Does he make a quick mastery of the symbols
of language? We should transfer him as quickly
as possible into simple reading books, offering him
a great variety of these, that he may feed his
imagination with good stories.</p>

<p>It has been said that the average American
child exhausts the possibilities of the Montessori
apparatus at the age of five years. Of course he
does. Dr. Montessori planned it as a means of
lighting the flame, touching the torch, opening the
switch.</p>

<p>With a marvelous completeness it does this.
Our part lies in keeping the flame burning, guiding
the express train of the child mind into the higher
places of reason, imagination, and personal
achievement.</p>

<h2 id="THE_GREAT_SILENCE">THE GREAT SILENCE<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Montessori Development of Repose</i></span></h2>

<p>It was an amazing fact, but a significant one,
that four-year-old Joanina had never been allowed
to <em>feel herself</em>.</p>

<p>As she lay in her carved-wood cradle, a bundle
of cooing, pink delight, she felt for her toes,
that she might assure herself of her own identity
as represented in those wriggling lumps
of flesh. But Joanina’s mother bound the little
limbs in swaddling bands and the <i lang="it">bambino</i> lost her
toes temporarily. When she was a bit older, and
was allowed to bask, kitten-like, on a rug in the
garden path, she was charmed to hold her flower-like
baby hands up to the light, watching the
Roman sunshine trickle through outstretched fingers
as she tried to count them. But, always, her
emotional, kindly intentioned <i lang="it">madre</i> would toss a
bright-colored ball into the reaching hands or,
bending over the baby, would play pat-a-cake with
her, or she would suggest a romp up and down the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
garden. Her self-imposed quiet was always interrupted
by her mother’s unrest.</p>

<p>As Joanina grew to a slim little girl of Italy,
whose great, wistful brown eyes reflected a large
curiosity and awe at the surprises of the world
in which she found herself, she was daily surrounded
by forces that drew her away from herself.
Her home was full of glaring colored pictures
hung on vividly dyed wall paper. Her
mother and father talked together in high-pitched,
shrill voices, and through the wide casement windows
came the harsh sounds of traveling street
musicians and brawling venders. Always, as a
treat on Sunday or a <i lang="it">festa</i>, Joanina was taken to
see a procession or to a band concert in one of
the parks. The crowded, hot stone streets, the
noisy cracking of the cab-drivers’ whips, the struggle
to make her own short legs keep up with the
longer steps of the <i lang="it">madre</i>, wearied and excited the
little maid.</p>

<p>But she grew accustomed to noise and boisterousness
in her days; she grew to expect them as
well. Then she came to depend upon <em>outside</em>
forces for keeping the motor of her baby spirit
going. She begged for new toys, exhausting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
quickly the pleasure to be found in old playthings.
She asked for new frocks, aping the vanity of her
mother and the other women she saw on the <i lang="it">Corso</i>
on feast days. She allowed her child playmates to
plan her games. She cried to be taken into the
turbid streets. From a placid, reposeful baby,
Joanina developed into a restless, passionate, distraction-seeking
little girl. Germs of discontent,
disquiet, hysteria were planted in her child soul.</p>

<p>When Joanina found herself one morning in the
Trionfale Children’s House, she experienced an unconscious
feeling of peace. The very wide spaces
of the two rooms where the little ones busily and
happily worked; the cool gray walls unbroken in
their sweep save by a blue and white terra-cotta
bas-relief here and there; the plain brown linen
curtains that softened and toned the yellow sunlight
and rippled with a flower-scented breeze—these
helped to make Joanina’s peace. Dropping
into one of the little white chairs, she looked about
her with eyes that again melted into the calm
wonder of her babyhood. She could not have explained
it, but there was already at home in her
life a new, quiet repose.</p>

<p>Surrounding her was a child republic that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
opened its heart to her. Some of the children, in
groups, were sorting and grading with quiet skill
scores of the silk-wound color spools. Others,
alone, were testing their knowledge of dimension
and form with the solid and geometric insets. In
a corner, a determined baby was trying to button
the apron of another baby. All were entertained,
yet no one was entertaining them. They were
making their own content.</p>

<p>Without warning, the directress turned from
the child whom she had been giving a lesson in
numbers with the counting case, moved to the
front of the room, and wrote upon the blackboard
one word, Silence. Then she waited, herself silent
and facing the little ones. Joanina, too, waited.
She did not understand; she was curious.</p>

<p>The children, recognizing the written word, one
by one laid down their work, dropped into positions
of quiet repose, their eyes closed. Some laid
their heads upon their folded arms. The room
became so hushed that such faint sounds as the
low ticking of the clock, the hum of a buzzing fly,
the gentle rise and fall of breathing, became vibrant.
The children’s faces were full of calm joy,
their bodies were completely motionless. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
had gone away from their small republic of work
and play for a space. Who could tell where they
were? Each child was feeling himself; for the
time being he was listening to the call of his own
personality.</p>

<p>Joanina, interested in the game of silence, closed
her eyes. She folded her restless fingers. She
waited, rapt, immobile as a little chiseled cherub.
It was perhaps the first time in her four years’
apprenticeship to Life that she had been given an
opportunity to listen to her own heart throbs, feel
the grip of her own personality. The experience
was satisfying to her. She heard and felt a great
many inner voices and mental forces that she had
never listened to or obeyed before. She heard the
voices of happiness in her new, peaceful environment
and love for the other children and joy at
the complete freedom that surrounded her. She
felt the impulse to <em>do</em> and <em>learn</em> as she had seen
the other children doing and learning.</p>

<p>For several minutes, the silence held the children
in its spell. Then, out of the stillness the whispered
voice of the directress floated. As a singing
wind of a far-away forest, a mountain echo, or the
low voice of a mother as it first makes itself audible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
to a new-born babe, came the voice: “Joanina.”</p>

<p>The little girl opened her eyes, meeting the
smiling ones of the directress, who made a gesture
indicating that Joanina should go to her quietly.
Poised on tiptoe, Joanina crossed the room noiselessly,
threw herself into the outstretched arms of
the directress.</p>

<p>“Mario, Otello,” softly the other children were
called until all had, as silently as Joanina, left
their places and surrounded the directress. Their
eyes shone, their faces glowed as if they had been
refreshed by an elixir bath. Yet the Montessori
silence game which had brought about this inspiration
and refreshing in the life of soul-starved little
Joanina might have been a part of her home life.</p>

<p>Your child needs it; <em>you</em> need it.</p>

<p>There is, perhaps, no more significant phase of
the Montessori system of education than the calm,
quiet habit of self-contemplation aroused by the
game of silence. The self-control, the poise, the
power of long concentration that one sees in the
Montessori children at Rome amazes the world.
They are completely lacking in self-consciousness;
they ask for help in their work only when it is
absolutely necessary; they are <em>sure</em> of themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>In writing about the game of silence, it has
been suggested that the game has an hypnotic
quality; that the calm, beautifully poised directress
imposes her own personality upon the children,
controls them as the hypnotist controls his
subject. This is not true. As the didactic materials
furnish the right means for the child’s
mental development, so the opportunity given
by the game of silence makes possible the
child’s moral and spiritual development. It
gives him a chance to listen to the “still,
small voice” that is a speaking voice in childhood
but which is drowned by the babel of world
tongues that we allow to make our song of life in
adult years.</p>

<p>The story of Joanina, the little Roman girl, is
retold in almost every American home. As we,
ourselves, depend upon public opinion, outside
amusements, entertaining friends, the judgment of
the press, the fashions of the day for filling our
lives, so we make our children, also, dependent
upon similar forces for forming their characters.
We surround children with gossip, we teach them
to depend upon excitement for their pleasure; we
build their ideals of conduct upon what the world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
will think instead of what their conscience dictates.
We make of our little ones modern Babes in
the Woods who lose themselves in a forest of bewildering,
overgrown paths. We give them no
chance to blaze their own trails.</p>

<p>What is the application to the American home
of the Montessori game of silence?</p>

<p>It begins with the American mother who must
cultivate a habit of quiet self-contemplation. She
must be able to shut out the world as did the stoics,
listening to the good voice of her own soul. It
means, also, that she will be less dependent upon
her environment for her daily thinking and happiness
and more adept at creating her own joys.
We are very restless, to-day, discontented unless
we are surrounded by friends or obsessed by passion
of some sort, or we must go somewhere. We
will try to slip back into the simple living of our
great-grandmothers, who had resources in themselves
and could be radiantly happy, pottering
over the lavender in their gardens or reading their
Bibles in the candlelight of some long-ago evening—alone.</p>

<p>The mother who cultivates in herself a habit of
repose will have reposeful children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>The game of silence, as it may be put into practice
in the training of children, begins with ear-training.
Shut out harsh sounds from the home
where there are little children. To command a
child in a loud voice often results in disobedience;
it makes him mentally deaf for the time being.
He does not hear what is said to him; it dulls
his senses. We all know how the memory of some
gentle voice that either sang or spoke to us in
childhood comes back to us, now, as a forceful
memory. It was the softness of that voice that
made the lasting record in our minds.</p>

<p>Often a mother may whisper a sentence to a
child, or call softly from different parts of the
house, asking the little one to locate her by the
sense of hearing. This will quicken and cultivate
the child’s power to listen and concentrate upon
the use of one sense. And we should eliminate all
unnecessary noises from our homes; the slamming
of doors, the crashing of dishes, harsh popular
music, and crude songs.</p>

<p>As the children’s sense of hearing is refined, we
will lead them to listen to the very small sounds
in the world about them, the soft breathing of
the sleeping baby, the far-away ticking of a clock,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
the hum of insects, distant footsteps, the patter
of rain, the song of the wind.</p>

<p>Then when this fine power of listening has been
cultivated, we may introduce the game of silence
itself. The mother may show the child that she
is able to sit quietly, immobile, relaxed for a short
period of time—only thinking. Then the little ones
may be encouraged to attempt the game, waiting
in perfect silence, with closed eyes, until mother
calls them in a soft whisper to “come back” to
the world again. To darken the room a little
during the game adds to its power. Gradually the
periods of the silence may be lengthened, and results
will show in the child’s life in greater control,
quiet, and life balance. In this repose and
silence, Dr. Montessori tells us, both adults
and children gather strength and newness of
life.</p>

<p>A little maid of three had been having her first
birthday party. Light and music and romping
games and many gifts had filled the afternoon
with unexperienced delights for the child. She was
trembling with delight, on tiptoe with excitement
when the children marched out to the dining-room
and were seated about the beautifully laid, rose-strewn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
table. At a signal the curtains were drawn
and the children were told to be silent and close
their eyes for a space. There was a vibrant hush,
a space of time passed, then one child after another
raised her head and opened her eyes. The room
was still darkened, but in the center of the table
had been placed the huge, white birthday cake
surrounded by a wreath of flowers; the only light
was the starry shining of three white candles on
the top. The little birthday child looked in wonder.
Then she drew a long breath and said in a
whisper, “Nearer, my God, to Thee.”</p>

<p>No one quite understood the little one. It
seemed to have been a vagary, a precocity on her
part. It <em>was</em> an unusual manifestation, but quite
explainable as we grew to realize the inspirational
possibilities of the Montessori silence.</p>

<p>When it is not possible, because we are dealing
with an isolated child, to put into practice the
game of silence as it is used in the Children’s
Houses, we can still lead the child to know and feel
silence. A quiet hour in the twilight after the
work and play of the daytime are over, a trip to
some still, lovely spot in the woods, a few moments
spent in the hushed interior of a church,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
will remain as reposeful memories in the life of the
child. More than repose, even, they may be inspirational,
as, shut away from the noise and activity
of the world, the child is able to hear the call
of his own spirit.</p>

<p>We all know and love Bastien-Lepage’s painting
of the maid, Jeanne d’Arc, listening to the
voices in her garden. The grass dotted with
flowers, the bending apple tree, the other homely
surroundings of the humble home that were all
Jeanne had known, fade away as the voice of the
prophetic soul speaks to her; as she sees the vision
of herself, the saviour of France.</p>

<p>Jeanne d’Arc was only thirteen when she began
to hear the voice of her spirit.</p>

<p>Millet, as a boy, saw nature with his spirit eyes.
He showed his father colors playing over the
rough sod of his home fields which no one else
could see. Rousseau, in boyhood, declared that he
was able to converse with his beloved trees and
they told him the secrets of their beauty. Samuel
was only a very little boy when he heard and
interpreted his Master’s voice. The boy Christ
heard a message that he was able to carry to the
doctors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>May we not give our little ones an opportunity
to step across the threshold of the present into
that great silence which begins life and also ends
it, and which is melodious for those who are trained
to listen?</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
